Her mother died when she was seven and Gae sought refuge at the Goodwood Orphanage when she was 13 to avoid a marriage that was being arranged by her stepmother. She lived at the orphanage for about two years and attended St Mary's Dominican Convent in the city. Gae shared the accommodation, routines, and recreations of the older girls at the orphanage and, while the lack of privacy is a strong negative memory, she has no regrets about her decision. Gae returned home in 1965 after her father's death but was still unable to cope with her stepmother. Mother Aloysius found her both work and accommodation outside the orphanage.","Dawson, Gaetana, 1950-;Italians -- South Australia -- Social life and customs;Stepchildren",Goodwood Orphanage Oral History;J.

Her mother made 70lbs of butter a week. Her father built their first house which was made of hessian and timber covered in lime wash with an earth floor. She worked on the farm and drove a plough. At 18 she moved to Merredin and worked as a waitress in the Commercial Hotel which was mainly used by commercial travellers and businessmen. They had a room to display their wares and most of them travelled by train. One brother stayed on the farm, another went mining in Kalgoorlie and the other joined the Navy and was in the Battle of Britain. Her father had 1,000 acres but only cleared 60 in his first year. The rest was cleared by contractors. Margaret met her husband at a local dance and dances were a big part of country life. She married Vin in 1931 at the beginning of the Depression. Swaggies called at the farm every day and they camped in their shed. They had five children. She talks about the local area and the way of life on the farm. Things improved at the end of the war and she boarded teachers to earn more money. The Army was at Nungarin and soldiers came to weekend dances.

His twin Noreen spent her life in a convent as a nun. His early memories were of horse teams and carting bagged wheat. He went to school at Nangeenan until it closed during the war. A bus run was established and it was the first school bus in Western Australia with glass windows. The Nangeenan area was settled under an English land grant system based on 160 acre homestead blocks. The first property was settled in 1898. It became the first rail head and provided chaff to the gold fields. The land clearing was very laborious as the timber was Satmon and Gimlet Eucalypts and it covered the valley floor. Other areas were mallee and in the 1950s and 1960s clearing was done with chains and tractors. His father grew wheat and oats and had milking cows and horse teams. Kevin went away to Aquinas College in 1946 and he left school at 15 to return to the farm. Put in his first crop in 1949. He describes the farm buildings, changes in technology, tractors, headers, and the innovation in equipment. His father developed the wheat auger and a mini elevator. He discusses the Junior Farm Clubs which the Education Department developed across WA. He went on a trip to America and learned from it. His father's original holding of 1300 acres increased by 1,000 acres in 1951 at a cost of 2 pounds an acre. He set up a farm management advisory service in 1961 and purchased other properties until they had 8,500 acres, 3,000 under crop and 4,500 ewes.

His father was unemployed for seven years then won 87 pounds in a shilling raffle, found a job, and life improved. In 1924 they moved into the British Arms and rented it. During the Depression in 1929/30 there was no work, no dole and people travelled all over looking for work. Many great works came out of sustenance money in the Depression such as the road to the top of Mt Wellington in Tasmania, the Wellington Weir and irrigation system. Rip obtained an apprenticeship in a foundry when he was 17. He made the first pump for Charlie Warman in 1938 in Kalgoorlie - they make the biggest pumps in the world. Talks about the community life in Kalgoorlie and the town of Boulder, the beginning of the Great Boulder Mine and the Golden Mile, how the town built up in Kalgoorlie and the establishment of the Council. At the beginning of World War II plants were dismantled to build Eyre Highway, aerodromes and rail lines. He joined the Air Force during the war and returned in 1946. He was stationed in New Guinea and involved in repair and maintenance. When the Japanese fleet left Singapore and headed to Australia it was thought that Perth was the target and every available plane was assembled in Perth. After the war he returned to Kalgoorlie Mine to work in maintenance and became the Maintenance Engineer in the North Kalgurlie Mine which mined nickel.

His next job was as overseer at Baldon Station, then Manager of the station. It was 25,000 acres and he had to repair 25 windmills. He married Meredith while he was on the farm. They wanted their own property so they moved to WA and managed properties for Perth doctors at Hopetown. It was very strict budgetting and a new land development. The rainfall was high and there was a different approach to livestock management. The land was over cleared. They lived in a caravan for 6 months with two young children. Many settlers lived in sheds for years. There was no telephone exchange or power. There was a lot of social interaction and a local theatrical group. All the grain went by road to Esperance and sheep and cattle to Katanning or Perth. The price of stock was the same in 1997 as it was 15 years before but the costs were much higher. The biggest changes were in manpower requirements and the need to have larger farms to make a living  the increased use of technology to access information  and the use of farm advisers.

Many South Australian rams were sent to Western Australia to improve their stock. AMP opened up a lot of country around Keith. There was a boom in the wool industry at the end of the 1940s with rapid increases in the price of wool from 1948 due to a world demand.

He was in the Army for six years and worked as a malariologist in New Guinea. After the war he worked in virology when myxomatosis occurred and he spent fifteen years working in this area. There were huge rabbit populations in the 1940s in south east Australia. The myxomatosis virus was first proposed in 1918 by a Brazilian but the government would not import the virus. He talks about the history of getting the virus introduced, tests in Australia and how it is transmitted. The work was done by Burnet and Jean MacNamara. Permission was given in 1942/43 to do trials on Wardang Island. He talks about Francis Radcliffe and Clunies-Ross and the establishment of the wildlife unit at the CSIRO. Myxomatosis was spread by mosquitos in 1950 and he started studying the virus for the ANU in 1951. He spent most of his time researching in the laboratory and continued the work for fifteen years testing rabbits which became resistant. Lake Urana became a major CSIRO study site. Testing rabbits with the virus resulted in a 99% mortality rate. The reduction in the rabbit numbers lead to an increase in the wool clip. He considers his work to be an unique experiment in evolution  balance between the host and parasite. Left his work in 1965 and wrote a book with Radcliffe. Then he moved into the smallpox program.

There were only 15 to 20 houses at Port Sorell which is about 12 miles from Devonport. From 1944 food prices improved dramatically. The main crop was potatoes. In 1950 he went cane cutting in Queensland for three years and then moved permanently to King Island in 1953. It was being cleared for soldier settlers. He worked on the roads for the Public Works Department and later formed a company with Reg Coates in land clearing and land development. There was plenty of work and they also developed their own farms in beef cattle. The property is now worth over half a million pounds.He started wood cutting as a child and now travels to the Australian agricultural shows. The Island was completely burnt out by bushfires in 1929 and they had bad fires in 1939 and 1983. Island life is now very modern with the airport, hospital, abattoir and many young people are living on takeaway food. There is still a strong sense of community and the island has a good future in dairy production.","Addison, Laurie;King Island (Tas.)",The Australian Rural History Project;J. D.

The interview includes discussion of her decision to enter the congregation of the Sisters of Mercy  her family's struggle to become established in Adelaide, being one of few Asian families in Adelaide at the time  the important influence on her of a number of the other Sisters during her schooling  and the importance to her of the Aquinas Group at the University of Adelaide, under the leadership of chaplain, Father Golden.  Sister Pak Poy describes changes to the school, and the Order of the Sisters of Mercy after the Vatican Council of the late 1960's, when the Church called on religious orders to look again at the gospel and at their founding principles. This brought about changes to dress, religious practice and community life. The proportion of lay teachers to Sisters changed in the school, and in 1973, the Sisters stopped wearing the habit, and generally began to live in small group houses instead of larger communities.  Sister Pak Poy notes the contribution of the Sisters of Mercy to the education of women and the improvement in the status and opportunities for women. The Sisters had an important social impact at the time. Sister Deirdre Jordan in particular made a great contribution in the area of curriculum development and administration.

Haggard [sound recording] Interviewer: Mary Rose Goggs,1973,20 minutes;Sound recording (tape reel) analogue,"Mr U Haggard was a previous Zoo Director of the Adelaide Zoo. The interview covers aspects of his early life and events that led him to become the Director of the zoo. His skills to direct a zoo were acquired gradually. He spent time as a schoolboy staying with the Minchin family who ran the zoo. Although he would have liked to be an engineer, he worked with animals in a stock firm. On becoming secretary of the zoo this work held him in good stead. He introduced a new system of book keeping and record keeping. On the death of the Director he took over the job. As this was during World War II staff was hard to get and money was limited. Mr Haggard views zoos as primarily educational. In earlier days the research function was limited. The Quarantine Department restricted the choice of animals. Birds were not  permitted for many years. King penguins were brought in but did not survive. Precautions were taken during the War in case animals were liberated during an air raid. He relates stories of emus and an orangutang escaping. A young hyena was hand reared was well as a gnu. During his time at the Zoo as Director the most important exhibits to arrive were a rhino, orangutang, giraffe and elephants. Sir William Norrie and HG Wells were among the many notable visitors to the zoo. Emu egg omelette was on the menu when the Comedy Harmonists visited. He was not in favour of circuses and performing animals but animals were sent to circuses if breeding led to a surplus. He comments on man wiping species off the earth, suggesting it would be better if the animals were left to carry on.","Haggard, U.;Adelaide Zoological Gardens;Zoos -- South Australia -- Adelaide;Zoo animals -- South Australia -- Adelaide;Captive wild animals -- South Australia -- Adelaide",Now in Retirement: 1972-74 (Radio program);J.

And it was Mr Sierp who had the responsibility of the changeover, in 1962, when the School of Art moved from the Exhibition Building, North Terrace, to its new quarters in North Adelaide.  It was he, too, who first introduced the study of pottery into South Australian schools. Mr Sierp is the author of what have become classic texts on the teaching of technical drawing, but for the general reader he is perhaps best known as the compiler and designer of a fascinating pictorial history entitled Colonial life in South Australia:  50 years of photography, 1855-1905.

His parents, Christine and Jack Tredrea, were Cornish. They moved to Adelaide in 1930 and opened a shop at 25-27 Gouger St and lived behind it. They opened the shop to trade in gold. The Market started when the man who owned the hay store donated it to Council to develop the site as a market. It was a very busy commercial centre with a large city population. West End was very working class. The Market and the arcade were built at the turn of the century. Laurie talks about the raffles, spruikers and the atmosphere. He married the sister of Ferris Trebilisi. He grew up working in his parents' shop and used to melt down old gold watches. People pawned clothes, rings and watches. At the age of 16 he joined the Air Training Corp to become a pilot. Went into the Air Force when he was 18 but the war was nearly over. During the war their shop moved from Gouger St to the heart of the Central Market Arcade. He built up the menswear area. Migrants bought a lot of clothes to send to families in Europe. They had about 12 shops. In the 1950s he moved into electrical goods but also traded in woollen jumpers at the Melbourne wool auctions. He ran give away competitions including 1,000 chickens. Began to pawnbroke again in 1961 and was the only one in the state. Had a weekly auction of unredeemed pawned goods. Started selling guitars when the Beatles visited and bought several music shops in Gouger St. He had 12 shops in the arcade which sold everything. Jack Wynet developed a few shopping centres and then the Market and he later bought David Jones. Describes the old markets and shops and what it was like after the redevelopment in 1967.

His father was born in 1898. He was in the Navy and then worked at the Market where he bought a fruit and nut stall in 1934. His wife Ada worked on it and ran the stall for many years. His father ran a drinks stall. Chappy talks about the Market in the 1930s. His father was the first President of the Stall Holders' Association. There were about 50 stalls including three selling sweets and two selling nuts. In the 1930s there was a market carnival where stallholders dressed up their stalls and then they were judged. The Market was visted by the Governor. Nuts were, and are, a luxury item. They used to visit the growers and buy products direct from them but this stopped with the introduction of the Boards. Chappy was enjoying life in the Navy when his parents asked him to come home and take over the nut stall. He did not want to do it and worked 16 years without a break from the stall. His father introduced roasted nuts and the roaster was built at Holdens. They used to sell a ton of peanuts on Friday. The nuts came from Queensland and many were imported. They had 12 girls working for them, each with their own scales. They had a thousand customers on a busy day. Brett Charlesworth is Chappy's son and he helped out at the stall from the age of 13 and enjoyed eating the products. Used to have Market picnics at Silver Lake in the hills and they went in a convoy of trucks. Now runs a stall with his brother Mark which they started in 1976 and he is very happy to work there. His father built up the business and built a warehouse but did not expand outside the Market until 1976. They now have 8 shops. Became involved in the Stall Holders Association when he was 17, became the Secretary and then President, on the committee for 9 years.

For her, an only child, the animals, especially horses, were her friends.  Peg was nineteen and studying Veterinary Science at Sydney University when her father died and the property was sold.  Although her mother strongly believed in the education of girls, she did not consider that her nineteen year old daughter could run a sheep property.  Indeed, Peg Christian speculated that her mother always thought that her daughter' s veterinary work 'wasn't anything terribly important'.  Peg Christian was a boarder, first at Frensham and then at Abbotsleigh independent girls schools.  She reflected on the advantages of single sex schools and the Headmistress' support for her ambition to be a vet.  Peg Christian recounts in detail the veterinary science curriculum, its strengths and weaknesses, the impact of World War II and the social life at Sydney University between 1938 and 1943.  She was the twelfth woman in Australia to graduate in veterinary science.  After graduation and before her marriage, she worked in a small animal practice on the North Shore.  Peg Christian stressed the importance of treating the owners as well as their animals.  When her husband took up an appointment as a government laboratory veterinarian in Alice Springs, Peg Christian opened her own private practice in the family home.  For this she is featured in the Pioneer Women's Hall of Fame, Alice Springs.  In 1952, the family moved to Adelaide and again Peg Christian started her private practice in the family home. Peg Christian is best known for her work with native animals, especially joeys, wombats and kangaroos.  She learnt by trial and error because care of native animals was not included in her studies at Sydney University.  As a pioneer in this work, Peg Christian's memories are a valuable record.

They introduced new foods and showed customers how to use them. Most of their customers are Australians. They took over the store in 1993 and have renovated three times. Most of their products are local or from interstate and they have 10,000 items in stock. They have several local growers and have fresh produce daily. Many Asians are not accepted by the market management. Australia is a peaceful country with better opportunities. In the market there are 83 leases covering 50 businesses.

SOLA began as an entrepreneurial venture in Adelaide in 1954. By 1959 SOLA was the path finder in the world of plastic lenses. The company was acquired in 1979 by Pilkington Brothers and in October 1981, at the age of 37, John was appointed Managing Director. It was in this role that John built a multi million dollar global business which gained worldwide recognition through its commitment to quality and strong technology base. John's talent for people management, hard-nosed marketing campaigns and new product development allowed the company's fortunes to soar. It established marketing operations throughout Europe, the Middle East, Africa, China and India. Whilst SOLA had international operations before John arrived, in 1988 he moved Head Office from Adelaide to San Francisco, for the clear purpose of having a better view of their world wide markets. SOLA competed in the international market with only two other companies- Essilor of France and Hoyer of Japan. In 1993 when the company was sold for US$114m to a private consortium (AEA Investors Inc.), John was appointed President and CEO. Two years later, SOLA was listed on the New York Stock Exchange. Finally, in 1997 AEA sold SOLA for US$343m. Away from the cut and thrust of business, there was only one activity that competed with record annual result- fishing. He chose Tasmania as his fishing home, with a ""shack"" on Jonah Bay, Arthur's Lake. Sadly, it was at this location, having spent some hours out is his ""tinnie"" that John died in January 2002, aged 58. John Heine is remembered as a formidable business competitor who demonstrated a fierce drive to succeed. Prior to his untimely death, John had commenced a series of philanthropic steps for those he saw deserving of his help. His dream is continued through his","Heine, John, 1944-2002",Sola Optical History Project;J. D. Somerville Oral History Collection,http://www.slsa.sa.gov.au/archivaldocs/oh/OH619_16.pdf

Although there was no tradition of tertiary education in her father's family, on her mother's side education was highly valued. Throughout her primary and secondary education, Joan, her brother and parents lived with her grandfather Kelly and her mother's oldest sister in the Adelaide suburb of St. Peters. She attended St. Joseph's Primary School and Loreto Convent. Books and reading, as well as sport, were an important part of her growing up. Joan reflected on the strengths of her own education and the advantages and disadvantages of attending an all-girls' school for secondary education. 'Loreto gave you confidence'. After a year's junior teaching, she attended Adelaide Teachers College for three years, completing her training for secondary teaching. Joan's professional interest in libraries began with her first teaching appointment at Naracoorte High School where she was asked to organise the new school library. After three year's teaching, Joan resigned from the Education Department to work in the Barr Smith Library, University of Adelaide. In 1957, she became the first Lecturer-Librarian at Wattle Park Teachers College and then Women's Warden at Western Teachers College. Joan reflected on the injustice of having to resign when she married in 1965 and that her long service leave both before and after marriage was not counted when she retired. Re Women's Movement, Joan considered that as a senior woman, she saw her role as supporting younger women. Joan Brewer started the first courses on school librarianship in South Australia. She explains in detail the growth of South Australian public libraries from the Institute system through to school-community libraries. Joan was a member of many committees, for example, Schools Commission, the Board of Education of the Library Association of Australia, Libraries Board of South Australia, Loreto School Council, and the Federal Government's Nation","Brewer, Joan, 1923-;Librarians -- South Australia",The Honoured Women Oral History Project Part II;J.

Her father was a farmer.  Mary won a scholarship to Methodist Ladies College for the last two years of secondary school.  Because her parents were elderly, she remained in Pinnaroo before her marriage to a doctor in 1951.  Between 1951 and 1971, the family lived in Booleroo Centre and Riverton.  Mary's voluntary work for the hospital auxiliary began in Booleroo Centre and with school committees in Riverton.  When the family moved to Adelaide, Mary joined the Unley Branch of Meals on Wheels in 1972.  The interview concentrates on Mary Davidson's work in Meals on Wheels and major developments in the structure and services of the organisation.  From sweets cook in the Unley branch, Mary Davidson progressed through Unley Branch President, State Vice President to State President.  She was the first woman to be elected State President.  Because she is also a Member of the Services Development Committee and the Policy and Finance Committee, Mary Davidson was able to discuss in great detail the developments in the services provided by Meals of Wheels.  For example she traced the changes in the cooking (now with combo-steamer ovens and the cook-chill method) and delivery of meals (from serving food individually in the clients' homes to food packed in aluminium containers).  Mary Davidson strongly supported the ideals of Doris Taylor, the founder of Meals on Wheels in South Australia, and, in particular, the centralisation of funds and the upgrading of buildings and equipment in all branches.  As an example of Meals of Wheels responsiveness to new developments, Mary Davidson discussed the introduction of direct debit for users to pay for the meals and the Meals on Wheels website.  She also discussed the role of the State Government who provides twenty per cent of annual income and is responsible for the Occupational Health and Safety Legislation which has driven many of the changes to the provision and delivery of meals to the frail and elde","Davidson, Mary Lucy, 1928-;Meals on Wheels Inc.

When he was eight the family moved to Zlin, an industrial centre founded by shoe manufacturer Thomas Bata. Bata Industries was founded in Czechoslovakia. They were responsible for filling in marshes to build the town of Batov. After the German occupation in March 1939 Danny became a student in the chemical section of Bata Technical College. Bata's philosophy was to select and train capable young people and invest them with the responsibility of running the system profitably. There was great enthusiasm. During the war all the universities had closed so very capable staff were employed in the Research Institute. He speaks about his education  his post-war professional development  and working under the communist regime. In 1944 he became involved in the Slovak national uprising and acquired arms for the Hungarian troops in Koitkovic. The Germans and Russians arrived in the area on 1 May 1945. The Russians liberated Otrokovice. He briefly joined the Russian Army as a volunteer and was involved in the liberation of Blansko. After the war much time was spent on study. His interest in spectrography led to his appointment as head of a physical laboratory under Professor Kubelka. He completed his studies and became an engineer in 1952. In 1953 he worked as a scientific aspirant for his thesis in leather technology. He talks about his marriage to Helena in 1953 and the birth of his children. He was awarded the degree Candidate of Science in 1959. In 1964 he returned to Zlin as General Manager of the Leather Research Division of Bata.

Elaine and her family have had a lifetime association with the Port Adelaide area.  Like her mother and grandmother before her, she attended Ethelton Primary School.  Elaine attended Port Adelaide Girls Technical High School for her secondary education and reflected on the pros and cons of single sex schools.  Although her family never had much money, Elaine recalled a happy childhood spent in and around the Port River.  She noted that expectations were not so high during her adolescence.  When her mother talked her out of becoming an infant teacher, Elaine did a commercial course and left school at year 11, aged 16 years, to work as a stenographer at Farmers Union.  Elaine noted that at that time, large businesses recruited junior staff at the end of the school year.  Elaine formed the first fan club and was its founding President for the rock band, The Masters' Apprentices.  When a group of male surf lifesavers decided to form the Taperoo Surf Life Saving Club, Elaine was asked to help with the clerical work.  Imperceptibly, and as she sees it a natural progression, Elaine became a member of the second female lifesaving squad in 1967/8.  In 1971, Elaine married Gavin Farmer, one of the founders of the Taperoo Surf Life Saving Club.  She stressed the enthusiasm and entrepreneurial skills of the young founders who had to raise money and build their own clubrooms on Crown land.  The lack of surf in the Taperoo area meant that there were few turf wars between lifesavers and surfies.  As President of Taperoo in 1984 and General Manager of Surf Life Saving in South Australia since 1988, Elaine was able to provide detailed information on the history, structure and growth of lifesaving in Australia.

When she was 12 years old, she moved with her family to Port Lincoln on Eyre Peninsula where she has lived ever since. In 1993, Moira Shannon was awarded an Order of Australia Medal for her extensive community work, in particular the establishment of the first Womens Shelter at Port Lincoln in 1978. Moira left school at 15 years to work first at housekeeping and then as a sales assistant and a nurse assistant. In a moving and remarkably frank account, Moira told the personal story behind her establishment of the Womens Shelter in Port Lincoln. Moira grew up a solitary, aggressive girl because her stepfather sexually abused her and her mother did not believe her story. At 21 years, Moira married a violent, alcoholic man with whom she had four children while fostering two others. With another woman in the same situation and a Church of Christ Minister, Moira founded the first branches of Al Anon and Alcoholics Anonymous in Port Lincoln in 1964. These organisations gave her the strength, the belief in a power greater than herself and the friends to divorce her first husband and study Social Work offered externally through the then South Australian Institute of Technology. After three years of lobbying and submission writing, Moira obtained funding to establish the Womens Shelter in 1978.  This brought her into contact with many feminists. She reflected on the necessary differences between womens shelters in urban and rural areas, for example the appointment of men to advisory boards in rural areas. The major issues for Moira are sexual abuse of children, domestic violence, and shelters for homeless youth and accommodation for intellectually disabled children. In all of these areas, Moira has been a driving force in establishing the appropriate organisations in Port Lincoln.

The interviewees concentrated upon personal memories of working for the Balfour Company, and their responses to the technological and organisational changes during their employment.  These interviews are of particular interest to long-serving Balfour's employees  those studying the work of bakers and drivers over 40 years  and historians of family companies.  Peter Corbo was born in Italy in 1943.  He emigrated to South Australia to join his sister in 1961.  When his own business went bankrupt in 1973, Peter joined Balfour╩╝s as a driver.  The hours from 5.00am to 2.00pm suited him with his young family.  Peter spent 17 years as a driver on the Unley, Munno Para, Barossa rounds and as a relief driver.  He recounts in detail the packing of the vans with first wooden and then plastic trays of orders for first the delicatessens and then later the supermarkets, the delivery schedules, the collection of monies and the promotion of new products.  He applied to buy shares in Balfours but these were bought back in 1985 as part of the management changes introduced by David Wauchope.  Peter introduced security into the company in 1986.  At one stage he was the security man, the storeman, the boilerman, the production reports and quality controller.  Since the company went into receivership in 1996, Peter has been full-time in security.  For him, being a driver brought great satisfaction but he regrets Balfour╩╝s going into receivership.  From Peter╩╝s  perspective, the difficult introduction of computerised packaging meant that he lost contact between the customer and the products.  He sees the movement to Dudley Park as part of inevitable progress.","Corbo, Elio Peter, 1943-",Balfour's Oral History Project;J. D.

These interviews are of particular interest to long-serving Balfour╩╝s employees  those studying the work of bakers and drivers over 40 years  and historians of family companies. Ray Gepp was born in Wright Street, Adelaide in 1952.  After leaving school, he worked for 5 years as a driver for Turner╩╝s Butchers.  In 1976, he went as a driver to Balfours in which position he has remained.  For 26 years, Ray has been doing to Brighton round of deliveries to delicatessens and supermarkets.  Because of his specialised work, Ray╩╝s interview concentrates upon the changes he has experienced in his work: from Morris to Bedford to refrigerated trucks  from two to one delivery per day  the promotion of new products and the decrease in the range of products.  In the beginning drivers were both promoters and cashiers because they collected the monies in cash.  Until the introduction of the computerised packaging system, drivers helped the female packers to load the wooden trays, now plastic trays, which were packed in the vans in the run sheet order of delivery.  Because he has been on the same run for so long, Ray developed personal relationships with shop owners, even to the extent of having keys for their shops.  In Ray╩╝s opinion, Balfour╩╝s quality has decreased over the years with the rise of supermarkets and service stations.  Ray╩╝s hours of work have changed from 6.00am to 3.00pm to 2.30am to 12.30pm.

Born in 1952, Susan ╩╗grew up in genteel poverty as an Adelaide Establishment family.╩╝  One of the themes in her professional life, that of an urban historian, began in her final year at secondary school when she did a project on O╩╝Connell Street, North Adelaide.  Susan recalled in some detail her mentors and the ambivalent attitudes towards Australian history and literature at Adelaide University during her undergraduate years.  Her Honours thesis, ""Images of the city in Australian Literature"" reflected her enthusiasm for ╩╗developing Australian culture out of Australia.╩╝  After graduation, Doctor Susan Marsden was employed to write the official history of the Woodville Council in 1975 where she learnt first hand about using primary sources.  In 1979, she joined the Heritage Unit.  Susan╩╝s reminiscences about the establishment of the PHA concentrate on the people involved and the issues which concerned the early years of the association, for example professional rather than public historians and pro bono work.  In Susan Marsden╩╝s opinion, the relations between professional and academic historians were never hostile, but the latter group were not very supportive of the former.  As a member of both PHA and the New South Wales association, Doctor Susan Marsden is very much aware of the complexities of federal relations, especially since she lived and worked in Canberra between 1995 and 2003.  While she was State Historian, Susan Marsden was a awarded a Churchill Fellowship in 1991.  This interview is a detailed personal account of the issues concerning PHA with many thoughtful recommendations for its growth and development.","Marsden, Susan, 1952-;Donovan and Associates",Professional Historians Association Oral History Project;J.

Interested from an early age in history and research and after completing his secondary education at Christian Brothers College, Bernard spent a year of work experience before completing an Honours History degree at Adelaide University in 1978.  Because he sought to be a professional historian working in the public domain rather than an academic historian, Bernard spent six months as a research assistant for a former lecturer before starting his MA thesis on the Department of Mines and Energy.  This thesis was published for the Department╩╝s Centenary.  In relation to the establishment of PHA, Bernard recalled the Honours History students discussing the possibility of an association in 1978.  Although the PHA was established in the early 1980s, Bernard O╩╝Neil did not join until 1985 when it became clear that he could get work as a professional historian.  He emphasised the necessity for public historians to acquire business skills and the role of the PHA in this professional development, for example the use of personal computers after their introduction in the late 1980s.  Bernard O╩╝Neil discussed in general terms the core individuals, especially the executive, who ensured the successes of PHA.  He detailed its publications, workshops, the campaigns about the disposal public records and discussion with the South Australian Privacy Commission.  Now the PHA is linked with the Australian Council of Professional Historians Associations and there are more national issues.  He noted the older age profile of PHA members and the declining number of university students taking Honours History degrees.  Bernard O╩╝Neil discussed the growth of Applied History courses and the involvement of the PHA.

Somerville Oral History Collection. The bare bones of Doctor Basil Hetzel 's active and productive public life are readily available in Who's Who in Australia, The Internet and his papers held in Archives of the University of South Australia.  This probing interview which concentrates upon Dr. Hetzel's personal assessment of his long and productive work brings life and movement to the formal records.  His great-grandfather came to South Australia in 1848, one of the Lutheran diaspora with Pastor Kavel.  The medical stream of the Hertzel family started with his father, who like his son Basil, was Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Adelaide University.  In a moving link between his own work and that of his sons, Dr. Hetzel noted that Robert is a practising doctor, Richard is in public health, and Jay was a CSIRO scientist.  The recurring theme in the interview is the importance of Christianity and in particular the university based Student Christian Movement for Dr. Hetzel.  His interest in the relationship between religion and medical practice led Dr. Hetzel to encourage full-time chaplaincy services in South Australia's public hospitals and the Lifeline 24-hour counselling services.  Dr. Hetzel married his first wife, Helen, in 1946.  After she died in 1980, he married his second wife, Anne Fisher the widow of one of his friends, in 1983.  The distinctive feature of Dr. Hetzel's work is its breadth and depth.  For example, he was not only one of the earliest researchers on the impact of iodine deficiency on thyroid disease, he also oversaw the introduction of iodine injections to prevent cretinism in Papua New Guinea.  Dr. Hetzel did not limit himself to the practice, research, teaching and administration of medicine at Adelaide and Monash universities.  From 1991 to 2000, he was the Lieutenant-Governor in South Australia a","Hetzel, Basil S.

He was born in 1900. His father died when he was six and his mother returned to England. He and his brother were with a guardian for two years and when their mother did not return they were put into the Goodwood orphanage. Darian Smith left the orphanage when he was 12 or 13 and joined the army medical core in 1916, putting his age up to 18. He stayed in England and nursed soldiers who caught influenza in the epidemic after the War. He did an art course at the London Polytechnic, returned to Adelaide and set up his own photography business when he was 26 years old. He was the first commercial photographer and did work for the Women's Weekly, Homes and Gardens and several businesses such as Holden's. He enjoyed aerial photography and documented the building of the Holden's factory at Elizabeth and took many freelance shots of Adelaide. He and his wife built a house in North Adelaide and as both were artistic, decorated it with style. The family had summer holidays when the businesses were closed over Christmas and often went to the Murray River on a houseboat or to Kangaroo Island. Darian Smith returned to the orphanage each year with presents for the children and remembered the nuns with regard. He took photographs of houses, gardens, medical research, aerial shots, the theatre especially ballet, shop windows, weddings, families during World War II for the soldiers away, the Adelaide Show, various businesses, and wineries. He developed Frank Hurley's photographs for Mawson after his trip to Antarctica. On the ship over to England in World War I he developed photographs taken by the soldiers so they could send them home. He had an artistic temperament, was very sociable and was an extremely hard worker. In his mid 70s he began to go blind and he died at the age of 84.","Savage, Pamela;Photography -- South Australia",Interview with Pamela Savage relating to her father Douglas Darian Smith;J. D.

When Clem first started, candles lit the champagne cellars, horses transported grapes from the vineyard, and the men rolled the hogsheads from the ground on to the trucks.  He described in great detail the making of the champagne yeast for champagne bottlings, the champagne shaking, and the cleaning of the vats.  In 1960, Clem was involved in the computerisation of processes.  From 1970, he led tours of Penfolds at Magill, in particular the expertise of Mary Penfold.  He also discussed the export marketing of wines.  Clem Adams worked through the Southcorp takeover of Penfolds.

R. Babidge & Sons was a cooperage firm which made casks, barrels, hogsheads and vats for the wine and beer industries.  This interview concentrates upon two separate topics.  Jack Babidge opens with a detailed description of the mechanised cooperage factory.  The wood used was mainly American oak and Tasmanian oak although the company did make a 50,000 jarrah vat for Hamiltons at Glenelg.  The firm made hogsheads for the export trade, and had to complete 150 per day during the season.  Jack believes that the introduction of concrete and steel in lieu of wood, and the loss of the export bulk trade were the most significant changes in cooperage in his working life.  Because Babidge & Sons was a cooperage firm, Jack did business with all the families in the wine industry.  He reminisced about members of the Wynn, Barry, Hamilton, Seppelts, Smith, Tolley, Kay, Angove and Hardy families.  Interstate wineries in New South Wales, Victoria and Western Australia were also customers of Babidge & Sons.  Jack Babidge retired in 1983 just when the family owners of wineries were relinquishing control to managers.","Babidge, Jack;National Wine Centre of Australia;R.

In 1977, he became a partner in the one of the earliest discount bottle shops at Pasadena. Until then, the wine, beer and spirit makers had carried the discount. Martin compares the growth of discount bottle shops with the decline of the corner grocery stores and the development of supermarkets. He and Bob Clampett purchased their second discount store at Hove. In his analysis of wine retailing in the large discount stores, Martin Bailey stresses the importance of knowledgeable staff, and a large and varied range of alcoholic drinks from all over the world. Like the other interviewees in this series, he notes the decline in demand for fortified wines. He referred also to the slowing demand for cask wines and the influence of driving under the influence legislation. From the original two bottle shops, Martin purchased the Vintage Cellars shops and forty other shops in Melbourne. During the high interest period of the late 1980s, Martin Bailey and his partner, Joe Fassina, scaled back their business to seven shops in Adelaide and marketed themselves as fine wine merchants. In his summary of the significant changes in wine retailing over the last twenty five years, Martin Bailey highlighted the dominance of the Coles and Woolworths chain liquor stores with their restricted range of products  the greater sophistication of wine buyers  and the pricing of wines.","Bailey, Martin, 1945-;National Wine Centre of Australia;Bailey and Bailey;Retail;Wine merchants",Treading out the vintage;J.

His mother came from Morgan in 1906. The family owned a large general store and there was no family history in the wine industry. His father's cousin Bill Redman introduced Doug to the wine industry. In the 1960s his family sold their 400 acre farm to Hungerford Hill from Sydney and he stayed on to manage it. Two hundred and fifty acres was planted out to grapes in 1971. He was given a lot of support from the Redmans, Ken and Lorna Ward in how to run the business. They planted Shiraz, Cabernet and Riesling and bought their stock from Reynella. The 85 acres of Cabernet was the biggest planting in the Coonawarra. They always machine harvested the grapes. The cellar door operation began in 1979. He was the first secretary of the Viticulture Council in the south east and Bob Hollick was the first President. Hungerford Hill was the subject of a takeover and it was bought by Katnook. They bought 200 acres from the Pitt family. He developed Greymoor vineyards with Geoff Merrill in 1988 and this was taken over by Mildara. He then developed properties for Kym Tolley and Vincorp. He formed a viticultural development company called Balnaves Management Services and his children Kirsty and Peter became involved in the business. They made wine on a contract basis and had their own label in 1990 and 1991 and had a winery in 1996. Peter Bisell was their winemaker. They make 10,000 cases and sell the rest as bulk wine, crush up to 900 tons, and they are always trying to promote the region of Coonawarra. The most significant impact has been mechanisation and soil moisture management. The future of Coonawarra is in maintaining the quality of the wines.

His parents were Frederick James Barry, a telephone engineer in PMG and his mother was Dorothy Barry. He left Murray Bridge when he was 10. Brother is Jim Barry a winemaker at Clare - also won the Magarey Medal for South Adelaide. Brian studied at Rostrevor College and won a scholarship to Roseworthy to study oenology. His brother was a year ahead of him. He talks about the teachers, study included a lot of practical work at wineries, including Stonyfell where he worked with the winemaker Jack Kilgour. After graduation in 1948 he went to Hamiltons at Glenelg. Syd Hamilton pioneered refrigeration with 4 x 5,000 gallon wooden vats in the 1930s. His brother was the first qualified winemaker at Clarevale Coop. His brother designed and built the winery in 1969 and in 1973 won a gold medal for Cabernet. Brian was dux of his class, went to Hamiltons, learned a lot from Syd Hamilton, made Ewell Moselle, best white in Australia, he was a chemist and would analyse the wines  supervised the grain and whisky sector. He stayed there from 1948 to 1952  went to Angoves at Berri as chemist and winemaker, it was the biggest coop in the southern hemisphere, stayed until 1976. Talks about John Fornachon at Roseworthy who helped establish the wine industry - he set up the Wine Research Institute. He started as a wine judge in 1962 and judged all over Australia - sherries were good but table wines were generally poor to start but improved greatly. Berri was mainly fortified wines when he started, made the first Cabernet in 1963, first gold medal for Riesling in 1972, mainly supplied bulk wines. His marriage broke up and he moved back to Adelaide to Stanley winery owned by the Heinz Company  won a gold medal for every wine he made. He disagreed with management and they fired him.

Jim Barry was born in Adelaide in 1925.  His wife Nancy was born and educated in Clare.  Jim studied oenology at Roseworthy Agricultural College and graduated in 1946.  He reminisced about teachers and friends from those days.  In 1947, Jim Barry joined the Clarevale co-operative winery as assistant winemaker where he stayed for twenty-two years and became the manager in the mid 1950s.  He explained that the winemaker's problems, when working for a grower's co-operative, arose from the lack of cash reserves and limited control of business cash for upgrades.  Whilst still working for the Clarevale co-operative, Jim bought land north of Clare in 1959.  The details of the purchase and the background to the development of the Barry winery will interest historians interested in the wineries of the Clare and extended valleys.  Other winemakers, such as Roly Birks, assisted Jim Barry.  The growth of the Barry winery was very much a family affair with Nancy doing the labelling, and their six children helping in the vineyards.  For Nancy and Jim Barry, there are the Clare, Barossa and Coonawarra winemakers all of whom helped each other.  Jim Barry acknowledged the role of wine casks in the transfer from fortified to table wines.  For him, the significant changes in table wines arose from the introduction of stainless steel and refrigeration.","Barry, Jim;Barry, Nancy;National Wine Centre of Australia;Clarevale Co-operative Winery;Jim Barry Winery;Clare (S.A.)",Treading out the vintage;J.

His parents were George and Emma Baxendale and his father was the local vet and his mother a nurse. His father bought 80 acres of scrub on McMurtie Road and sold half to the Trott family. He grew currants. There were only a few vineyards in the 1930s. He was educated at McLaren Vale and Adelaide High Schools. In 1942 he went into the Air Force. Prior to that he worked on his father's property and worked with horses. The main grape varieties were Grenache, Shiraz and Doradillos which were used for fortified wines. There was no irrigation in the area. There were five or six wineries and he talks about some of the locals. After World War II he returned to McLaren Vale and bought a 50 acre block which had been part of the original Wirra Wirra. He married soon afterwards and grew Cabernet and Shiraz. He sold the Cabernet after 2 years. The boom period was the 1960s and 1970s and they formed the Southern Vales Coop but most lost money from it. The wineries dictated the terms of what they wanted to buy. He gained most of his knowledge from neighbours and the Agricultural Bureau (on how to prune vines). Two years after World War II they bought their first tractor and cultivation improved. They did not get electricity until 1956. The yield was about 3 tons to the acre. The grapes in highest demand were Shiraz, Grenache and Mataro. They had a Vine Improvement Society which led to better vines and crops with good use of cuttings and grafting. He only hired people for pruning and picking. He talks about picking and carting. In the 1980s the prices improved and there was an increasing demand for table wines. The biggest change has been hydraulic motors and picking machines.","Baxendale, Alex, 1921-;National Wine Centre of Australia",Treading out the vintage;J. D.

Arthur Beckwith was born in Cowell in 1912.  After winning a scholarship, he went to Roseworthy Agricultural College and graduated with first class honours in viticulture in 1932.  Searching for employment during the Depression, Arthur Backwith spent some time wool classing at Plumbago Station, as a cadet working on cultured yeasts at Roseworthy, and at Hardys at Mile End before starting with Penfolds at Nuriootpa in late 1934.  There he was able to implement his research on pure cultured yeasts.  Arthur Beckwith did most of his early work on fortified wines and the old system of making table wines.  He provides many details on these wine practices, their strengths and weaknesses.  In 1936/1937 Arthur Ray Beckwith was a pioneer on pH indicators to eliminate the problems of bacterial growth and spoilage.  In the 1940s, Arthur turned his attention to improving Australian sherries.  At Penfolds, Beckwith worked alongside Max Schubert and John Davoren and the interview includes his memories of these men.  The 1950s saw the introduction of new equipment to improve juice extraction which saw table and sparkling wines coming into their own.  Beckwith was a member of the Australian Wine Institute established in 1957.  For Arthur Beckwith, the significant development in the 1960s was the importation of new varieties of grapes, for example Pinot Noir.  He travelled overseas regularly and reminisced about the Gallo winery in California.  He notes the impact of the wine taxes and various food acts on winemakers.  The interview concludes with a summary of Arthur Ray Beckwith's views.","Beckwith, A. R. (Arthur Ray);National Wine Centre of Australia;Penfolds Wines Pty.

His father had a 5 acre fruit block and had shares in the Waikerie Coop. His parents names were William and Marion. Roger went to Roseworthy and talks about the people there and the work he did. He moved to the research station at Griffith in 1948 and stayed for 6 months  then worked at Tahbilk for 18 months  worked with McWilliams in Yenda in the champagne area  went back to South Australia to work at Seaview for Ben Chaffey  and worked at Kaiser Stuhl in Nuriootpa. Roger talks about the wine making processes. He moved to Wynns in 1961. He picked up Wolf Blass in Sydney when he arrived from Germany and he talks about Wolf Blass and how he became established in the industry. Wynns set up a winery in Yenda. Wynns was taken over by Tooheys who then sold it to the Adelaide Steamship Company. He talks about his time at Wynns and the changes to the types of wine they made. He went to the USA to look at new equipment and talks about changes in technology, various takeovers and their impact on the industry and Colin Gramp and Guenter Prass.;What is now Wynns Coonawarra Estate was founded by Scottish pioneer John Riddoch. He planted vineyards in 1891 and completed the estate's three-gabled winery. In 1951 Melbourne wine merchants Samuel and David Wynn purchased Riddoch's original vineyards and winery and renamed the property Wynns Coonawarra Estate.  The Wynns family recognised the intrinsic qualities of Coonawarra wines - their richness and intensity of fruit character - and set out to build an independent identity in the region. They created the famous label that has made John Riddoch's winery one of Australia's best known buildings.","Blake, Roger, 1927-;National Wine Centre of Australia",Treading out the vintage;J. D.

His grandparents had a distribution centre in a bottling company and his mother worked there. He was brought up during the Second World War and lived in East Germany. He had to learn Russian. He crossed the border to West Germany in 1948 and was a viticulture apprentice until 1952. He attained a Diploma in Wine Making and then worked 5 years to get a Kellermeister (Master of Wine Diploma) qualifying when he was 23. He went to London in 1957/8 and stayed 3 years. In 1961 he accepted an offer from Ian Hickinbothan at Kaiser Stuhl to come to Australia and make pearl wine. Ian was very theoretical and ahead of his time but was not very practical. They had to compete with Orlando who made Barossa Pearl. Wolf found it difficult socially to meet women in the Barossa. He was accepted into the Bacchus Club but there was very little socialising in the wine industry. He created and marketed sparkling wines. He made fruit wines - pineapple pearl and cherry pearl. Men started drinking more wine and women started to drink wine. Six to seven family companies controlled the whole market. His Riesling was the first to win prizes at the Royal Adelaide Wine Show. He made his first vintage of 3,000 bottles in 1966 when his agreement with Kaiser Stuhl was finished. He made Charmane sparkling wine. In 1969 he started work at Tolley, Scott and Tolley and in 3 years they became the most successful red wine exhibitor in Australia. He then became an independent winemaker. He began blending wines to make them drinkable. He made wines that were easy to drink and quicker to mature. He has 54 scrapbooks of newspaper clippings. In 1974 he was the first independent winemaker to win the Jimmy Watson trophy. He won 9 or 10 Montgomery trophies. 70% of Wolf Blass products are exported. He first started exporting in Oceania in the 1970s. He talks about John Glaetzer, Peter Lehmann, and the Barossa Vintage Festivals.

John Glaetzer joined the company and from 1974-1976 Wolf Blass Wines won three consecutive Jimmy Watson Trophies, the Black Label generated substantial publicity and hype.  From this time onwards growth was impressive with Wolf Blass Yellow Label and Riesling becoming Australia's top selling red and white wine. Exports first started in the mid-1970s to New Zealand, Fiji, Hong Kong and Singapore and in 1984 Wolf Blass Wines became a publicly listed company.  By the end of 1990, the number of National and International awards totalled an incredible 2,575 comprising:  135 trophies 712 gold medals 812 silver medals 869 bronze medals 47 diplomas.

Lita bought a property in 1974 and worked with Roly Birks for 8 years. He was a winemaker who taught her how to make wine. She studied at Charles Sturt University in Wagga from 1983. She describes Wendouree and the processes they used. They grew Shiraz, Cabernet, Malbec and Mataro and later Riesling. Initially made dry reds and fortifieds  she used to drive to hotels to sell the wine  Tim Knappstein at Stanley Wine was very helpful  a lot of comraderie in the industry. She uses a mix of original equipment and new technology  made their last vintage port in 1986  she started to have input into how things are run in 1985  she runs the picking gangs and her husband Tony does the vintage  she did the problem solving and they trialled different solutions to wine making  they use open fermentation in stainless steel, wine is held at 21'C  the vineyard is not irrigated, they get 26"" of rain which is all they need for red grapes. Tim White wrote about them in the 'Financial Review' in 1995 and their sales increased as a result. They still hand pick and it takes 10 days to do 11 hectares and crush 50 tons a year. Roly died in 1988 aged 80, he had been a winemaker since 1917 and retired in 1988. They tried to continue his tradition. They no longer do cellar door sales and only sell by mail order or phone. They sell 2,000 cases and they do not export their wine.;For many lovers of big Australian red wines the discussion begins and ends with Wendouree. Truly exceptionally cellar-worthy, these full bodied and gripping red wines are the result of extremely low yields from the very old, unirrigated vines of Shiraz, Malbec, Mataro (Mourv├¿dre), and Cabernet Sauvignon, many of them growing on untrellised bush-vines.   As remarkable as the wines are, even more remarkable are Tony and Lita Brady, who consider themselves the custodians of a priceless treasure: the 1914 stone winery, its original equipment, the time-honoured method of wine making and the time-forgotten vineyard at Clare. Tony Brady, holds a degree in law and Lita Brady, a fully qualified winemaker (Charles Sturt University) devote their lives to keeping Wendouree what it always has been: a place of honest, old fashioned, careful and artisan wine making where no short cuts are taken.

His parents are John and Patricia Brown. He talks about the Brown Brothers winery which started with his great grandfather planting grapes at Milawa Victoria and the first production of wine was in 1889. The grapes were Shiraz, Riesling and Muscat and all the wine sold on the domestic market. His father joined the winery in 1933 and John in 1958. It was only small when he started, only crushing 120 tons. Also had sheep and crops. 70% of the wines were table wines and 30% fortified. They sold the wine in Melbourne but it was difficult to sell the table wine. They sold it in bulk. John describes the crushing process  he was the winemaker  he was strongly influenced by Bryce Rankine at the Wine Research Institute  talks about the people who influenced him  the frost in 1967 destroyed their 1968 vintage  this led to sinking a bore which gave them the ability to regulate production  they also bought 500 acres at Swan Hill called Mystic Park which was frost-free and a property at Whitlands  they now have five vineyards with a variety of grapes. John went to Europe in 1972 and went to the Wine Research Institute in France  looked at advances in technology in Germany  and made many changes on his return. He employed more winemakers  became the CEO of the company  he had been the winemaker for 30 years  built a ""kindergarten"" winery for experimental work and most of their new wines came from there. They decided they would stay a family business and turned down offers of mergers. His brother Ross established an export market in 1972 in the UK and Europe. Tarrango has had very big sales in the UK. They enter their wine in the city wine shows. Company developed new labelling in 1983. The wine industry has been successful because of its industry strategy and the biggest advance has been the change in technology.;Background: John Graham Brown joined the family business in 1958 after completing his education at Scotch College in Melbourne and married local school teacher, June Ellis in 1965. After the birth of his son, John Andrew, he assumed responsibility for winemaking in 1969 and completed a food technology course in the mid 1970s, following the birth of Cynthia Louise, his second child. John's interest in winemaking had been paramount for most of his formative years. He'd spent most of his youth, outside school, driving tractors in the vineyard, pumping wine, pressing grapes or washing vats and generally helping around the receival yard and in the winemaking process. It was no surprise therefore that he chose winemaking as his speciality. Following in his father's footsteps John's innovations spanned not only experimentation with different grape varieties, but also the processes utilised in winemaking. As a result it was not long before new and improved machinery was appearing. A major landmark was the installation in 1962 of refrigeration at Milawa, permitting a range of winemaking techniques that were previously not viable. In 1963 hydraulic pressing was introduced and in 1977 cold sterile bottling techniques commenced. Expansion was rapid in the 1970s with a succession of excellent vintages, the installation of winemaking equipment including Potter fermenters and the establishment of the Hurdle Creek vineyard. Throughout the 1970s and 1980s John sought many innovative directions to increase wine quality both through the vineyard (cool climate grapes) and the winemaking process. In 1988 John Charles Brown felt ready to hand over the company management to John Jnr and at that time John relinquished his post of Chief Winemaker. However, one of his dreams was to construct a miniature, stand-alone winery in order to experiment with every aspect of winemaking. It was during the family's centenary year in 1989 that his dream was realised.

His parents were Richard and Valerie Buller who were winemakers from Rutherglen. His grandfather was also a winemaker mainly with fortified wines. Rutherglen was a wine region from the 1860s and all the wine was exported mainly to England. The vineyards were decimated in the early 1900s by phylloxera and major replantings were initiated by the Victorian government. In World War II his grandfather enlisted in the Navy and was stationed in Adelaide so his father studied at Roseworthy. Many Rutherglen boys attended local state schools, Scotch College in Melbourne and then Roseworthy. Andrew's early memories were of playing in the winery and the workmen. Talks about the seasonality of the work. After World War II the influx of Greeks and Italians transformed the Murrumbidgee into a haven of viticulture and orchards. Their restaurants in Melbourne created a market for table wine. His father was a wine judge and travelled to many country shows. At home they drink very little wine, only drink in moderation. As a child his father worked 5 and a half days and was very family oriented. The industry is now based on tourism and they work all hours, 7 days a week. Roseworthy was coeducational when Andrew was there, previously all boys. Bryce Rankine was Dean of School. Industry moving from fortified to table wines. Thirty students with a range of experience. He did practical experience in New Zealand at Corbans. He met a lot of Dalmatians and Yugoslavs. He was at Roseworthy 1978 until 1981. He went to Portugal 1981 to 1986 and France in 1986. Talks about the wines the family made in the 1950s. Biggest change he has seen is refrigeration, especially important for wine wine.

During the Great Depression of the 1930s, Noel's father established Wilsford Wines to make his own fortified wines rather than sell his grapes to the large wineries for next to nothing. After completing his secondary education at St. Peters' College, Noel went to Roseworthy Agricultural College where he was one of the first students in the oenology course. This long interview includes his clear memories of the Roseworthy students and staff. During the college vacation, Noel worked at various wineries in McLaren Vale. After graduation, Noel joined the Berri Co-operative from 1938 until 1950. During World War II, Noel was in a restricted occupation and could not enlist. He noted the employment in the winery during the war. At that time, the Berri Co-operative was the largest in Australia because of the funds it received as part of Government support for the soldier settlers returned from World War I. Noel was in charge of technical winemaking. In 1950, Noel returned to the family farm where he became involved with vineyard work and the apricot harvest as well as making the fortified wines for which Wilsford was highly regarded. Noel Burge believes that the important development in the 1950s was the introduction of European grape varieties released by the Phylloxera Board. This was accompanied by the vine pull which must have included old Shiraz vines, most suitable for Penfolds Grange. Noel considers that the best Shiraz is grown on the Coonawarra limestone subsoil. In 1964, Noel Burge took more grapes than he needed to help the growers.  Fortified wines required strict security and record keeping to meet excise demands. Noel believes that he came too late to making dry table wines. He has kept many written records and the interview is peppered with detailed stories.","Burge, Noel, 1917-;National Wine Centre of Australia;Wilsford Wines",Treading out the vintage;J. D.

Grant provided the family history from its beginnings in the Barossa Valley and noted that Wilsford Wines is named after the Wiltshire village from where the family originated. Grant never joined the family business, partly because fortified wines were dying out in the 1970s. After secondary school at St. Peter's College, Grant spent one year at Roseworthy, an unhappy experience for someone who had always wanted to be a winemaker. After nine months as a cellar hand at Glenloth, Grant was appointed as a laboratory technician to the newly established Southern Vales Co-operative in McLaren Vale. He considers that his virtual apprenticeship there kept him more in touch with public taste and ensured his later commercial success. He learnt much from the older winemakers, such as Jack Kilgour. Grant was involved in the full range of winemaking, including making fortified wines, no longer taught. Southern Vales Co-operative had great success in the mid 1970s wine shows which combined quality grapes and winemakers skills. From an overseas wine study tour in 1975, Grant Burge decided that Australia could enter the export market, but he still wanted his own business. In 1977, Grant Burge and Ian Wilson started South Australian Vintners with facilities provided by Jim Ingoldby, and the growers and builders who were prepared to wait for payment.

His father was Swedish and his mother a Scot. His father did the boiler work for Seppelts and had a small vineyard on the Freeling Road. Gordon recalled the close knit Greenock community and the bartering which enabled families to live on the low wages. In 1928, Penfolds asked his father to take over the boilers at Magill and the family transferred to a cottage on the Penfold estate. Gordon remembers the underground champagne cellars, all dug out by hand with a horse and dray to take out the dirt. At harvest time, the growers lined up in their horse and drays to deliver the grapes. A characteristic of Penfold employees were the number of families with more than one member of the family working there, even though many were laid off at Christmas time, especially during the Great Depression. After attending Magill Primary School and Norwood Technical High School, Gordon started work at Penfolds in 1938. His general duties included walking Leslie Penfold Hyland's dogs as well as vineyard work. The grapes came from Modbury and the Riverland as well as Penfold Estate. Gordon Colquist enlisted in the air force in 1941 and saw service in Canada, England and Sierra Leone. He returned to Penfolds in 1946, to the bottling department and the cellars. This was when Penfolds was exporting wine to Canada and people like Gordon often worked from 'five in the morning until eleven o'clock at night.' Gordon was there when Max Schubert developed Grange and he gives a vivid personal account of the early vicissitudes with Grange. Like other interviewees, Gordon attributes much of the success of Grange to Ray Beckwith's work with yeasts. At this time, Gordon was in the laboratory learning to test red wines. Penfolds went for profitability, first with red and then white wines. Gordon appreciated working for a family firm and noticed the changes when it became a public company. He worked at Penfolds for fifty years.

His father emigrated from Sicily in 1925 and his mother in 1927.  For Italians, vines are another form of income on a mixed farm.  His father only made red wine, which he sold in demijohns around the Perth area.  The fertile swamp lands around Perth were developed as market gardens and there was a strong ethnic community when Paul was growing up.  Paul Conti took over the vineyard from his father in 1968.  Paul credits Dorham Mann, the Department of Agriculture adviser, with improving the quality of Western Australian wines.  Paul describes in detail the changes in equipment and winemaking he had to introduce to ensure the changeover from making bulk to table wines.  Equipment purchases have to be planned over a four year period to cover repayments.  Conti wines are now exported to Tokyo and Japan through agents.  Paul believes that the Australian market is harder than the export market, but he believes that he has been helped by the parochial support for local wine.  He uses a distribution agency for the Perth metropolitan area.  Cellar door sales and a restaurant have always been profitable.  Paul and his winemaker son, Jason, are not interested in amalgamation or getting too large for a family business. Paul's detailed account of the changes in planting vines highlights the importance of mechanisation.

After the war Doug went to Sydney for six months, then back to Melbourne to work for his father in his liquor shop at Toorak. He then went overseas and his first stop was Marseilles. He was away for 15 months and did wine courses at Dierhard, Bordeaux and London. His father died in 1954 and left his business to his staff and children. His brother looked after the food side and he did the liquor side building it up to 7 liquor stores. Wholesalers controlled the price of wine and breweries the price of beer and withheld beer when he tried to free up the sale price.

He decided upon the oenology course at Roseworthy Agricultural College.  Although there was no tradition of winemaking in his family, he knew the Hardy and Haselgrove families and therefore was able to have the necessary work experience for admission to the oenology course in 1949.  David's reminiscences include his memories of fellow students.  He stressed that when he began the wine industry was dominated by family businesses with very few management openings for outsiders.  From his student days, David was always interested in the marketing of wines.  He became the Sales Manager for Haselgroves at Reynella and in 1957 he introduced the first wine service course at the School of Mines.  Because he was a Sales Manager and with his social contacts, David's interview has a great deal of detail on individual personalities.  Readers are advised to listen to the audio tape as well as read the transcript for the names of particular people and firms.  David Crosby was working at the time of great changes in Australian wines with the decline of fortified wines and the introduction of refrigeration to improve white wines.  After three years working for PA Management Consultants, David Crosby had the necessary management experience to be appointed General Wine Manager for companies such as Gilbeys and Hungerford Hill.  Heart problems and perhaps nepotism meant that David Crosby left the wine industry to establish his own consultancy practice outside the wine industry.

Vasse Felix was founded in 1967, by Dr Tom Cullity, with the aim of making the best possible wine. Thirty-five years later, the Vasse Felix team still share the same philosophy, which is reflected in the show successes and consistency of quality.  The vineyard took its unusual name from an early event in the district. Vasse was a French seaman who drowned last century when his longboat overturned near the site of Busselton while exploring the coastline on the ship Geographe under Captain Freycinet.   Paradoxically, Felix is the Latin word for fortunate or lucky, thus the name refers to a favoured place in Australia discovered by the French.  The Vasse Felix red wines are some of the very best in Australia, Both Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz are produced and these wines continue to win trophies in all wine shows they enter.  Indeed, the 1996 Shiraz not only won the best dry red at Adelaide in 1997, it won the Best Wine award at our own Festival Wine Show held for the first time in November, 1997!  The range of Vasse Felix wines is impressive, apart from the reds there is everything from a sparkling Brut right through the classic white varieties to a Noble Riesling dessert wine.

He studied Agriculture at the University of Western Australia  did wine appreciation courses at the Education Centre in 1971  worked at the Department of Agriculture  did a winemaking course at Roseworthy College  bought property at Margaret River in the early 1970s  planted grapes in 1976  made his own wine in 1980 - Ashbrook and began to export the wine overseas.;Ashbrook Estate is the very essence of a Margaret River winery. Small, out of the way with a dedication to making the finest wines possible.  Although the Devitt family had owned land in Margaret River for more than 50 years it was not until 1975 that they purchased what was to become Ashbrook Estate.  The choice of the property was based on the presence of deep red brown loamy soils covering gently undulating terrain dissected by streams. The natural vegetation of large Eucalyptus trees suggested well drained soils, eminently suitable to premium wine grape production.   The first vines were planted in 1976, and 1979 saw the first commercial vintage at Ashbrook Estate.  The Devitt's concentrate on maximising the varietal characteristics of their white wines. Riesling, Semillon and Verdelho are all unwooded and show fresh lively fruit characters, while the Sauvignon Blanc and Chardonnay undergo barrel fermentation and maturation in high quality French oak barriques, which add complexity to the already flavoursome wines.  The Cabernet Merlot is a blend of 85% of Cabernet Sauvignon and the remainder is equally Cabernet Franc and Merlot The wine matures for two years in French oak barriques and puncheons, is bottled then matures for at least two more years in a temperature controlled cellar, before market release.   Ashbrook aims to develop a complex estate style with excellent cellaring potential rather than a simple varietal dry red.  Recently, Ashbrook have been very successful with their 2001/2 Sauvignon Blanc. The 2001 won Silver at the 2001 Sheraton Wine Awards. The 2002 went one step better and picked up the Gold at the 2002 show. Both are outstanding wines and worthy winners.

His parents were Italian immigrants who made their own wine and he grew up within a red wine culture.  Stan trained as a pharmacist.  He went to Griffith and for about fourteen years ran his own chemist shop.  Then with Aldo Piloni?, Stan established the San Bernardino winery at Griffith in 1973.  To learn about winemaking, Stan enrolled at the initial oenology course at Wagga Wagga, now Charles Sturt University.  Tony Jordan and Brian Croser established the course.  San Bernardino began with the big advantage of selling house brands for Grace Brothers who paid within seven days, giving the winery a great cash flow, not a common practice in the wine industry.  Among San Bernadino's innovations were Cream, an alternative to Bailey's Irish Cream, and a de-alcoholised wine which was very attractive to the Mormons.  The company took advantage of new developments in both technology and marketing.  It was exporting to United States and Canada as well as Japan, Hong Kong and Singapore.  After thirteen successful years, San Bernadino had financial problems with the banks and the premises were sold to de Bortoli.  After some years back in Sydney, Stan established Kirkham Estate Wines at Camden in the Nepean/Hawkesbury Valley outside Sydney.  He has visions of establishing a co-operative in the area, the Macarthur Wine Centre, and being in the forefront of new technological developments in all aspects of winemaking.  For South Australians unfamiliar with new developments in New South Wales, this is an interesting interview.;Kirkham Estate is one of six or so wine producers near Camden, a far cry from the 18 producers of the mid-nineteenth century but still indicative of the growth of vineyards and winemakers everywhere. It is the venture of Stan Aliprandi, a former Riverina winemaker with an interesting career going back over 30 years. It draws upon 9 hectares of vineyards, planted to chardonnay, semillon, verdelho, petit verdot, shiraz, merlot, pinot noir and cabernet sauvignon, supplemented, it would seem, by grapes (and wines) purchased elsewhere.     Product Range: Traminer Riesling, Semillon, Semillon Chardonnay, Chardonnay, Botrytis Semillon, Pinot Noir, Lambrusco, Merlot, Cabernet Sauvignon, Tawny Port.

He was a winemaker at Stanley for three years. Colin Gramp introduced refrigeration which was new to the industry. Wine was sold in bulk. His grandfather died in 1956 and his father was diagnosed with cancer in 1957 so he went back to Rutherglen in 1958. The vineyard had been planted in 1907 and was very run down. There were many varieties of grapes and most of the wine went to St Leonards. They made 5,000 gallons in his first year in wooden casks with a hand pump. In 1964 he became a wine judge. Rutherglen was fifty years out of date and using very old equipment. They had a good reputation for their fortified wines. George Smith started the Rutherglen Wine Festival in 1967. Things improved when they moved from bulk to bottled wine and developed a good cellar door trade. His wife died in 1986 and he remarried in 1989. Gradually started to export wine to the USA.

The family moved to Adelaide when he was 15  he left school in 1965  went to Flinders University in 1967 and studied Agricultural Science with a view to a career in wine. Tom Hardy agreed to support his further studies and apprenticed him to go to Davis. Jack Kilgour was a consultant for Tom Hardy. Brian studied at Davis for 3 months and travelled for three months in Europe. He wrote a thesis on hydrogen sulphide and returned to Hardys and made wine for them at Waikerie and Tintara, mainly Rieslings. He became their roving winemaker including working  in 1975 at Siegersdorf. He wanted to be a chief winemaker so went to Charles Sturt as a lecturer. He wrote the course and lectured and built the university's winery in 1977. Also consulted for San Bernadino at Griffith and made the prize winning Gewurztraminer for Petaluma in 1977.

His mother was Mabel Adelaide White from New Zealand. They moved to Fitzroy in Melbourne when he was 9 months old. After World War 2 he gained government funding to study accountancy. In 1955 he was employed as an office manager for the Wynn family. He talks about Sam Wynn, their financial system, the disorganisation, initiative of introducing flagons which made wine affordable to more people, introducing a cash flow system for Wynns, enabling them to get a return before they had to make payments. David Wynn established Coonawarra. He talks about some of the winemakers. Frank became General Manager and took over the Victorian distribution, he represented Wynn's on industry bodies, became the first national president of the National Wine Industry. The retail part of the industry was run by the breweries. Major changes introduced by the Whitlam government were the Trade Practices Act and the valuation of wine for stock purposes. Dan Murphy and Malpas had the idea for the wine cask and David Wynn developed it into a marketable product. In 1983 Frank became a member of the Australian Wine and Brandy Corporation. Wynn became a public company and in 1972 they were taken over by Allied Vintners who also owned Glenloth and Seaview Wineries and Tooheys Brewery. Frank stayed on as Director and became a director of Tooheys. He was responsible for bringing Moet and Chandon to Australia. He was also responsible for getting the remuage machinery from America. He talks about establishing Yenda Estate Services which is now run by his sons. Frank retired in 1985.;What is now Wynns Coonawarra Estate was founded by Scottish pioneer John Riddoch. He planted vineyards in 1891 and completed the estate's three-gabled winery. In 1951 Melbourne wine merchants Samuel and David Wynn purchased Riddoch's original vineyards and winery and renamed the property Wynns Coonawarra Estate.  The Wynns family recognised the intrinsic qualities of Coonawarra wines and set out to build an independent identity in the region.

Drayton's and Tyrrell's are the oldest surviving family wineries in the Hunter Valley.  South Australians unfamiliar with the history of the Hunter Valley wineries will find this interview provides an interesting comparison with the relevant South Australian interviews.  In his discussion, Max Drayton concentrates on the changes in the type of grapes and their cultivation that he has experienced in his lifetime of grape growing and winemaking: from working with horses to fully mechanised harvesting. He gives a wonderful description of ploughing in between the vines with a specially trained horse. He also worked through the times when Australians moved from drinking fortified wines to table wines and modified accordingly his winemaking practices.  Max Drayton recalled the winemakers he knew, including South Australian vignerons.  He has lived and worked through many changes in the Hunter Valley  from the time when grapegrowers kept cattle to see them through the bad years to the growth of the Hunter Valley as a significant tourist area.  In Max's opinion, the growth of the tourist industry has brought many problems for grapegrowers, especially in the cost of land and environmental concerns.  Max Drayton believes that government policies and the associated taxes on the valuation of stock have caused many problems for winemakers.  Nevertheless his life has been one of real enjoyment despite all the pressures and changes.;The Drayton's are one of the Hunter Valley's pioneering winemaking families and it is one of the few companies that is still family owned and operated.  It has been over one hundred and forty years since the first Drayton trod on rich Hunter Valley soil.  That Drayton was Joseph Drayton. Joseph was born in 1825 at Lincolnshire in England and at the age of twenty seven set sail for Sydney with his wife, Anna, and their two small boys. Tragically Joseph lost a son, a new born daughter and his wife during the voyage.  In 1853 he and son Frederick journeyed to Lochinvar and after several years moved to Pokolbin where Joseph acquired 80 acres of land. This was cleared and Joseph built the ""Bellevue"" homestead. In the late 1850's, Joseph turned from growing grain to plant his first vines in the rich virgin loam of ""Bellevue"".","Drayton, Max, 1931-;Drayton's Wines;National Wine Centre of Australia;Hunter Valley (N.S.W.);Horses",Treading out the vintage;J.

Colin's father, Hugo Gramp, along with Tom Hardy and Sydney Hill Smith, was one the three South Australian winemakers killed in the Kyeema air disaster in 1938.  The strength of this interview is in the fact that Colin Gramp integrates the history of winemaking in South Australia with the history of Orlando, the family wine company until 1970.  After completing his secondary education at St. Peter's College, Colin spent 1941/2 studying oenology at Roseworthy Agricultural College.  He joined the the RAAF in 1942 and was demobbed in 1945.  During leave in England, he visited the company's agents there.  On his way home, Colin with two other winemakers, spent three months in California where he learnt how to modernise the Australian wine industry through automation and bulk handling.  In 1947, Colin Gramp was appointed Technical Director of Gramps Orlando at a time when 80% of wine grapes were made into fortified wine.  In 1953 Gramps purchased two cold and pressure fermentation tanks which prevented oxidation.  These enabled Orlando to make and  market Barossa Pearl, light sparkling wine very popular in its day.  Colin's description of the making of Barossa Pearl is very detailed as is his account of the introduction of the Orlando Ribbon series.

Keith worked in marketing in Melbourne from 1949 to 1972. He retired in 1985.

The first vintage was in 1850, the year his son Gustav was born. Johann Gramp gradually extended and improved his property and with the maturing of his vineyards was able to increase wine production. The first born, Gustav was joined by two other sons and four daughters. The original 44 acre farm extended to 244 acres.  Johann was the Barossa's first commercial grape grower and vigneron. However, he viewed his winemaking largely as an adjunct to general farming. It was Gustav who, when he took over from his father in 1877, paved the way for the next era of expansion. He transferred the cellars to the present site. Again luck played a part but so did good husbandry and good government. Gustav Gramp maintained the tradition of steady growth from the new base at Rowland Flat, planting new areas of vineyard and increasing fermenting and storage capacity as each came into bearing. In 1912 the business was sufficiently prosperous to warrant conversion into a limited company. It became G.

He studied dairy technology and worked as a research assistant in farming for 10 years. In 1970 he joined a farming partnership and moved to Busselton in Western Australia. The farm was beef cattle and large scale vegetable plantings. This was sold after 2 years. In 1973 he worked as manager/winemaker for Tom Cullity at Vasse Felix which came into full production in 1977. The winery was sold to Robert Holmes a Court in the 1980s and David stayed for five years.;Vasse Felix was the first commercial vineyard and winery to be established in the Margaret River region of Western Australia.  The vineyard took its unusual name from an early event in the district. Vasse was a French seaman who drowned last century when his longboat overturned near the site of Busselton while exploring the coastline on the ship ""Geographe"" under Captain Freycinet.  Paradoxically, Felix is the Latin word for fortunate or luck. Thus the name refers to a favoured place in Australia discovered by the French.  In 1965 Dr John S Gladstones emphasised the region's suitability on his report ""The Climate and Soils of Southern WA in relation to Vine Growing"". Two years later Dr Tom Cullity planted vines and Vasse Felix was born.    The bird depicted on the label is a peregrine falcon.

His father was a fitter and turner at General Motors Holdens.  Daryl was the youngest of five children.  After his mother died, Daryl lived with his brother Terry who was the Member for Hansen and a Minister in the Dunstan Government.  Like his brothers, Daryl undertook tertiary education.  He enrolled at Roseworthy Agricultural College in 1976, the first year the College became co-educational.  Upon reflection, Daryl considered that he learnt more from working as a cellar hand during vacations than he did at Roseworthy.  He attributed this to his youth because his teachers were excellent.  After graduation, Daryl started work as assistant winemaker at Kaiser Stuhl.  When that company was taken over by Penfolds in 1982, Daryl remained with the company for a further twelve years where he was involved with the making of Grange.  In 1989, he went to California to look after Penfolds interests there.  Always interested in consumer preferences, Daryl learnt a great deal at Geyser Peak in California where in 1992 the LA Times named him Winemaker of the Year.  He still regularly visits Australia.  Because of his local, national and international experience, and his determination to reflect critically upon his working life, Daryl Groom gave a very thoughtful interview.  This was period of significant changes in the wine industry with the introduction of new grape varieties, new styles of wines and mergers and overseas takeovers.

He studied Law at the University of Sydney and worked for the Clayton Utz law firm. He became a partner in 1966 and left in 1974 to work for a merchant bank but returned in 1976 as a managing partner. He bought land in the Hunter Valley at Hungerfords in 1970. It became Brokenwood and won gold medals for the first vintage wines. He began judging wines in 1977 and wrote his first book in 1979, ""Wines and History of the Hunter Valley"", then books on Clare and the Coonawarra, then the ""Australian Wine Compendium"". He knew Len Evans, Max Schubert, and Jack Mann. He sold Brokenwood in 1983 and moved to Coldstream Hills  retired from the law firm in 1988  Southcorp took him over in 1996.;Established in 1970, Brokenwood Wines has evolved from a weekend venture for self-professed hobby winemakers into one of Australia's most reputable wine labels. Brokenwood was founded by a trio of Sydney-based solicitors -- Tony Albert, John Beeston and James Halliday -- who paid a then record price of $970 per acre for a 10-acre block in the foothills of the Brokenback Ranges. The original block (originally planned as a cricket ground for the local community) was planted with Cabernet Sauvignon and Shiraz. The first vintage was picked in 1973. It was a labour of love for the partners, and the friends and families they conscripted to help, with the grapes being carried to the winery in buckets in the back seat of Len Evans' Bentley. Brokenwood's inaugural vintage yielded 75 dozen Shiraz - Cabernet. While none of the original partners claimed to know anything about viticulture, the wine received praise, and attracted a loyal following from its first vintage. In 1975, a new winery was built to accommodate the growing production. The winery housed fermentation tanks and oak barrels and, in dorm-style accommodation, were the exhausted bodies of the many helpers who came to stay at Brokenwood, seduced by the promise of clean country air, fine food, wine and company in exchange for help on the vineyard. Visitors helped themselves to a taste of the very limited and eagerly sought after ""boutique"" wine made by Halliday and his band of weekend winemakers from a table standing in the shade of the first floor balcony. Many of Australia's most prominent wine identities ""did their time"" in the vineyards at Brokenwood during the 1970s. Growth was steady until the boom of 1978, when six new partners joined, allowing the purchase of the next door ""Graveyard Vineyard"".

With two other Sydney lawyers, he founded Brokenwood in the Hunter Valley in 1970 and, after moving to Melbourne for his law firm in 1983, he and his wife Suzanne established Coldstream Hills in 1985. He worked as a hands-on winemaker at Brokenwood, did several stints in France, and at Coldstream Hills before increasing age persuaded him that jumping in and out of open vats could be a terminal health hazard. As a journalist he has written over 45 books and several thousand newspaper and magazine articles, winning a number of major wine writing awards in Australia and the United States. He was also awarded Australia's most prestigious wine award - the Maurice O'Shea Award - for Outstanding Contribution to the Australian Wine Industry, in 1995.;""Coldstream Hills is the creation of James Halliday, Australia's doyen of wine writing (and just about everything else to do with wine).

Robert talks about the wine making process  joining the family company after World War II  handling distribution in Victoria  the winemaker Maurice Ou (Frend)  and the involvement of other family members in the business.;Hamilton Family Wine History. The Hamilton family has a proud heritage of grapegrowing and winemaking spanning more than 160 years. The story begins with Richard Hamilton (1792-1852), who in 1837 was granted Land Order 449 in the colony of South Australia, entitling him to a small property on the Adelaide plains. After a four-month journey from England on the 'Katherine Stewart Forbes', he arrived at Holdfast Bay near Adelaide with his wife and eight children. Shortly after his arrival, he planted the first vineyards on the Adelaide plains from cuttings sourced from South Africa. These vines formed the foundation of the Hamilton Ewell Wine Company. Later plantings saw the development of more traditional varieties such as Shiraz and Grenache. A small number of these gnarled old vines still bear fruit today in some of the world's last urban vineyards at Marion, Adelaide. By the 1850s Richard's third son, Henry Hamilton (1826-1907), had planted additional vineyards and established his own wine cellars, securing a significant local market for Hamilton Wines. In 1875, Frank Hamilton (1859-1913) joined his father Henry in the family wine business and became the manager from 1890. During these years, Frank produced a Chablis-style dry white wine. In 1928, Frank's son Sydney (1898-1987) pioneered the Hamilton's Ewell Moselle. This was a milestone in Australian winemaking. In the mid-1930s, Sydney began experimenting with cold fermentation techniques, and went on to use a refrigerated cellar to control the fermentation in the production of quality Germanic-style white wine. Later, he utilised mechanical refrigeration to chill must prior to fermentation. Sydney's story continued in Coonawarra, where, at the age of 76, he established Leconfield Wines in 1974. Cabernet Sauvignon comprised the original plantings  however, Sydney saved a small section of the best soils for Riesling cuttings he had sourced from his Happy Valley vineyard in Adelaide. This enabled him to continue producing dry white wine.

His father, Alan, was Deputy Principal at Roseworthy and worked in soil science. He had many scientific achievements and was a very good teacher. Ian had a two years apprenticeship at Hardys Winery. He studied oenology at Roseworthy, then worked at Wynns in Melbourne running their laboratory. David Wynn bought Coonawarra Estate. Ian went to Tolleys at Hope Valley, then to Kaiser Stuhl as the technical manager. He talks about the development of the Kaiser Stuhl range of wines and the rapid growth of the company. He went overseas in 1962 to London, California, New York, and Russia. He introduced the ""bag-in-a-box"" at Penfolds. Ian bought Jeannies restaurant in Toorak and ran it for ten years. He wrote for the Financial Review, the Age and the Wine State.;The Hickinbotham Family have been involved in wine making since 1936. They have been at the forefront of Australian wine production for three generations. This dates back to the early 1920s when grandfather 'Hick' initiated Australia's first scientific wine making course at Roseworthy College. The use of the pH meter in Australian winemaking has been attributed to his foresight and expertise, and its implementation has helped put Australia's wines on an international level. Second generation Ian Hickinbotham was the first winemaker at Kaiser Stuhl in the Barossa Valley where he oversaw the production of many famous Australian icons, such as Sparkling Reingold and Gala Spumante. Ian's crowning glory was the famous 1952 Wynns Coonawarra Dry Red. Ian and son Stephen, leased the Mt Anakie vineyard in the early 1980s where they launched such brands as Elgee Park, Stoniers and Meadowbank. During this era the family made wines from all over Australia and helped to establish the Scotchmans Hill winery. At this time the Hickinbotham family were also making wines for most of the early Mornington Peninsula vignerons. The 1988 vintage consisted of 24 different chardonnays, each from a separate vineyard.","Hickinbotham, Ian, 1929-;National Wine Centre of Australia;Roseworthy College;Kaiser Stuhl, -- South Australia",Treading out the vintage;J.

In 1985, Robert was appointed Managing Director of Yalumba, making him one of the youngest MDs the Australian wine industry had seen. His appointment came at a time when the Australian wine industry was poised on the brink of a revolution that would see a major shift in Australian wine consumption. Four years later, in 1989, Robert and his brother Sam bought out the family members, thereby ensuring the growth and future direction of the company.

She studied Botany and Zoology at Adelaide University. She met Stephen in 1973 and they married in 1975. They moved to Kyneton after a trip to Geisenheim in Germany to study viticulture. Both worked in the Hunter Valley and at Roseworthy in 1979/80. They joined the family business and bought land at Lenswood and planted a vineyard using the German technology. Prue talks about vineyard development, wine exports and concerns about the environment.;Why Lenswood?  I was employed at Roseworthy Agricultural College as a technical assistant in viticulture at the same time that Dr Richard Smart and Peter Dry were summarising the viticultural climates in Australia, and the Adelaide Hills looked good. From my university days studying botany I knew that the Adelaide Hills was a unique, wetter, more humid, botanically rich climate which could not be found anywhere else in South Australia. The future vineyard was positioned right at the top end of a long beautiful valley of apple orchards and natural forests at an altitude of 550 metres, an annual rainfall of 1134 millimetres and 15 kilometres north-east of Mount Lofty (700 metres). Now we have pinot noir, chardonnay, riesling, merlot and cabernet sauvignon planted over a 16-hectare property.  The merlot has a rich fleshy structure with spicy berry characters - mulberries come to mind when tasting this wine. This is proving to be the flagship wine style for the Adelaide Hills vineyards. The cooler growing and ripening period of this region suits the variety and produces intense, spicy wines that go so well with lamb and game, especially hare and kangaroo.  The pursuance of quality has been achieved in such a short time, but there is always a cost. The different vineyard management that comes with high rainfall, steep slopes (30-40%), and upright curtain-foliage training has meant pioneering new techniques and different machinery. We adopt the 'minimum soil disturbance' attitude so vineyard preparation is a whole new ball game. We use pasture grasses as a green sward between the rows, which the Soil Conservation Board considers in a much better light than many other crops such as potatoes and brassicas. We still have a few things to rectify such as achieving a taller curtain of foliage and finding suitable acid soil tolerant-rootstocks to guard us against phylloxera. We also have different types of trellis to cope with high vigour in various spots in the vineyard.

After finishing his secondary education at St. Peter's College and science and commerce at Adelaide University, John spent eighteen months overseas, working at the Australian Wine Centre in London, travelling through France, Italy, and Germany for two vintages before coming home through the United States.  Between 1925 and 1970 Angoves had their own company in England.  Angove's winery started at Tea Tree Gully but his grandfather moved the major operations to Renmark in 1910.  This interview is a goldmine for readers seeking a personal account of the development of Angove's winery.  For example, John Angove charted the company's change from fortified to table wines  the various types of grapes planted in different vineyards  and the mechanisation of harvesting.  There is a detailed examination of the development, type and popularity of St. Agnes Brandy from its introduction in 1925.  John Angove detailed his father's achievements.  He examined the impact of government policies and practices, for example, fixed pricing, the demise of co-operatives, brandy excise, wine equalisation tax and the forced acquisition of the Tea Tree Gully vineyards.  John Angove considers that the future challenge for the Australian wine industry is to maintain its quality and the world wide recognition of quality, while the challenge for Angoves is to be one of the best recognised names in Australian winemaking.

In 1984 he travelled to New Zealand and attended a wine show at which he was then able to identify the region responsible for this remarkable Sauvignon Blanc as Marlborough. The next year, 1985, he talked his financial backers into buying some land in Marlborough. The first release was 1985, but the winery had not yet been built, so the 40 tons of grapes that were harvested had to be trucked 400 miles north to Gisborne, and winemaker Kevin Judd effectively made the wine by phone. The second release, 1986, found its way to the UK, and was rapturously received by the media. The legend of Cloudy Bay was born! The winery now crushes about 800 tons of grapes annually, some of which are produced by six long-term contract growers. Cloudy Bay Vineyards was established in 1985 by Cape Mentelle, the Western Australian winery, which today is a part of the Moet Hennessy Wine Estates.   The company farms 140 hectares of vines at three carefully selected sites. Vineyards planted in 1986  surround the winery in the Wairau Valley at Rapaura, with additional plantings at nearby Renwick and in the Brancott Valley, in the southern foothills. Five long term contract growers also work closely with Cloudy Bay. The main varieties grown are sauvignon blanc, chardonnay and pinot noir with lesser quantities of riesling and gewurztraminer. The average annual crush is 1200 tonnes.  The winery takes its name from the bay at the eastern extremity of the Wairau Valley.

He went into sales. When they were taken over by Seagrams he was made redundant and moved to Yaldara in 1985. He has been a wine consultant since 1981 working for numerous wineries.;In 1959, when young James Irvine was buying grapes in the Eden Valley for the famous ""Siegersdorf"" Riesling brand he was developing for Hardy's, he dreamt of one day being able to plant his own vineyard up there high in the ranges above the Barossa Valley.   Some 20 years later, that dream became a reality when he took a chance and bought the Springhill property and established his first plantings. Today, Jim Irvine, his wife and business partner Marjorie and their winemaker daughter Joanne live and work from Springhill, and the Irvine range of wines are garnering an international reputation for excellence. Jim celebrated an astonishing 50 years in the wine industry and there's not much he hasn't done in that time. Vat washing, viticulture, sales, marketing, managing, consultancy, lecturing, public relations and of course, winemaking, have all been covered in depth.   Landmarks along the way included the development of Siegersdorf in the 50s and 60s, the building of the Krondorf name in the 70s and the establishment of his own widely respected wine making consultancy in the 80s. He's worked for Australian names like Glenloth, Hardy's, Krondorf, Seagram and Normans, had spells abroard, including Champagne, and continues to help a raft of top Barossa wineries in his consultancy role.

However, viticulture was carried out on a small commercial scale on a subsistence basis. With the demands created by the impact of the phyloxera epidemic in Europe in the 1870's, Australia was suddenly thrust into the world market with huge demand for wine at very good prices.    At this time a group of prominent Adelaide businessmen including GF Cleland, Johan Basedow, Sir Samuel Davenport and four other shareholders approached the farmers of the Barossa with a plan to capitalize on this opportunity. They understood the Barossa had 560 very good growers of grapes with an undisputed wine culture. These businessmen built the biggest wine making building in the Southern Hemisphere to process the grapes of these 560 growers. They financed the venture, shipped the wine on their boats to England and France and maximised on the shortage in Europe.    The farmers benefited from this arrangement year after year. The only proviso was that they contracted all their grapes to the Ch├óteau for a minimum of 10 years. A company was formed, called the Adelaide Wine Co. later to be called Ch├óteau Tanunda Pty Ltd and the Ch├óteau was built in 2 years 1888-1890.   Ch├óteau Tanunda has had only three changes of ownership in over one hundred years:  1890-1916 Adelaide Wine Co. later called Ch├óteau Tanunda Wine Co.  1916-1998 Seppelts Wine Co. (became Southcorp)  1998-present Geber family  Its heritage is remarkable in viticulture. Many of today's most successful grape growers and their ancestors have worked and provided grapes to The Ch├óteau. There are still some 300 growers in the valley. By far most of these are descendants of the original 560 growers who had a direct link with the Ch├óteau. A walk around the Ch├óteau is a walk around the history of winemaking in the valley, if not the country.

Wine was transported in casks by lorries, work was done on the property by horses until the late 1940s when tractors took over, pruning was by hand, they had 150 acres of vines, also an orchard of pears, apricots and apples. They had no trouble during the Depression and had regular workers. During the 1930s there was a good social life in McLaren Vale with local dances, golf and cricket. Cud was the first in the region to plant Riesling grapes. During World War II he was a tank wireless operator but he never left Australia. He was in the 12th Armoured Regiment which was disbanded as the tanks they were using were too big for the tropics. Biggest changes in the wine industry were the use of tractors and mechanical harvesting and technological changes.

In 1971 he bought 44 acres at Murrumbateman and began planting a vineyard. He talks about its development and working on it mainly on weekends. He left the CSIRO in 1997. Did the wine course at Wagga 1984 to 1989. He won a gold medal for his shiraz in 1990 at the Griffith Show. Son Tim Kirk is a winemaker. Has been making Viognier since 1998 which won top wine in New South Wales.;Clonakilla was established in 1971 by John Kirk, a Canberra based research scientist. Of Irish descent, John came to Australia with his young family in 1968 to work with the CSIRO Division of Plant Industry. To his surprise despite the suitability of the environment there was no wine industry in the cool southern table lands of NSW around Canberra. To remedy this situation, in 1971 he bought a 44 acre farm near the village of Murrumbateman in New South Wales, 40 kilometres north of Canberra. The soil consisted of sandy clay loams over a friable clay subsoil and, with a climate not dissimilar to the Bordeaux region and Northern Rhone valley in France, he held high hopes for its wine producing potential. He proceeded to plant 1.2 acres each of Cabernet Sauvignon and Riesling. He named the property Clonakilla (ΓÇÿmeadow of the church') after his grandfather's farm in County Clare.    A further 1.2 acres of Shiraz, Chardonnay and Pinot Noir were planted in 1972 and the vines grew well, although some were lost in a drought in 1972-73. John persevered and produced the Canberra District's first commercial vintage in 1976: a Riesling and a Cabernet Shiraz. It wasn't until 1978 when a bore was sunk that larger plantings became feasible. From 1978 to the present the vineyard was gradually expanded with Shiraz, Viognier, Riesling and the Cabernet family, now making up the bulk of the vineyard.    At the end of 1996 John's fourth son Tim left a career in school teaching to work full time in the family business as winemaker and general manager. In 1998 Tim and his wife Lara bought the 50 acre property next door and planted Shiraz and Viognier as well as a small olive grove on the warm north-east facing slope.

Today, Alkoomi is one of the largest family-owned wine producers in Western Australia. The Lange's son Wayne, daughter Sandy, and extended family members are all actively involved in the business.  The Alkoomi vineyards and winery share similar climatic conditions to those found in Bordeaux, France thus it is not surprising that Alkoomi produces some of the finest wines made in Australia.  The name Alkoomi is taken from a local aboriginal dialect and translated means ""a place we chose"".  The Alkoomi logo is a stylised representation of an Australian grass tree which grows in the area.  Alkoomi's red wines enjoyed success early on and Alkoomi has continued to produce elegant cabernet, shiraz and cabernet blends. The quality of Alkoomi Riesling has helped establish the reputation of Frankland River as one of the best areas for this variety in Australia and the Sauvignon Blanc is also regarded as one of the best in the country.  The consistently superb varietal flavours across a wide range of Alkoomi wines have been recognised by the doyen of Australian wine writers, James Halliday, awarding Alkoomi a five star rating in his ""Guide to the wines of Australia"".  Alkoomi's annual production of about 80,000 cases is distributed to all parts of Australia and is exported to more than ten countries in Europe, North America and Asia.","Lange, Merv, 1941-;National Wine Centre of Australia;Alkoomi Wines;Frankland (W.A.)",Treading out the vintage;J.

In 1960 he was appointed Winemaker/Manager at Saltram Wines, also at Angaston. He held this position for twenty years and it was here that Peter grew his reputation for high quality, innovative Barossan wines. It was here also that he developed strong and enduring friendships with his local growers. Peter Lehmann took Saltrams from crushing 400 tonnes to 6000 tonnes. The independent growers with whom he dealt learned that you could trust Peter implicitly. The formation of Peter Lehmann Wines. In the late 1970s a serious overproduction of grapes brought great hardship to the Barossa grape-growing community. As winemaker at Saltram, Peter Lehmann had been buying grapes from some of these growers since 1960. To accommodate the glut the multi-national company, which then owned Saltram, ordered him to go back on his word to the growers that he would buy their crop. This he refused to do. They were mates and Peter Lehmann was not prepared to stand by and watch them go broke. Calling on friends and relations, Peter Lehmann put together a financial package to form a company outside Saltram. It was a big gamble and, with his tongue firmly in his cheek, Peter named this new company ""Masterson"" after Damon Runyon's fictional gambler, Sky Masterson. Wine was made, buyers were found and the growers were saved from financial ruin. Two vintages were produced in this manner but, meanwhile, there was another change in the ownership of Saltram. If the growers' livelihoods, and the vineyards, were to be protected in the long term, it was clear to Peter that he would have to strike out on his own. He found investment partners, gathered around him a great team including Andrew Wigan (now Chief Winemaker), Mick Anderson (Engineer) and Leonie Lange (Winemaker) and built a modern winery on the outskirts of Tanunda in record time.

He was educated at the Marist Brother's College in Maitland and graduated in 1960. It is not surprising that he chose winemaking as his career path and became an apprentice winemaker with Penfolds. As part of the apprenticeship, Brian was sent to various wineries in the Penfolds' group to gain a full understanding and training as a winemaker as well as attending a course in Adelaide. He learnt to make wine from such industry icons as Max Schubert, Ray Beckwith, Don Ditter and, of course, his father Perc. In 1970, Brian and his wife Fay founded the Wyndham Estate Wine Company which is located at Dalwood in the Hunter Valley. As Managing Director of the Wyndham Estate Group, Brian built one of the most successful wine companies in Australia. During his time with Wyndham, Fay and Brian saw great potential for Australian wines in the International market place and became one of the early pioneers of export. Accordingly, Wyndham became one of the leading exporters of Australian wine to the world. Following the takeover of Wyndham in 1990, Brian established a new company  Brian McGuigan Wines through a publicly listed Company in 1992. In the dozen years since the formation of the Company, growth has been extraordinary with total sales now approaching 6 million cases. Brian's faith in Australia to produce premium quality wines is evidenced by the fact that the McGuigan Company now controls and manages approximately 13,500 acres (5,300 hectares) of vines throughout Australia which puts it amongst the country's top two wine growers.

D. Somerville Oral History Collection. In this interview, Kym Bonython, scion of one of the first white settlers in South Australia, interweaves his personal stories with the State and International events which shaped his work experiences.  His grandfather Langdon Bonython owned and edited The Advertiser from 1884-1923.  Kym╩╝s father, John Lavington Bonython also worked in the newspaper, but as Kym noted, his father  ╩╗really devoted most of his life to civic affairs╩╝ as Lord Mayor and member of the Adelaide City Council.  Kym Bonython recalls in fond detail his memories of his parents and grandparents, the houses where they lived, his schooldays and his mother╩╝s influence on his musical and artistic development.  From an early age, Kym Bonython was an enthusiastic jazz fan who became a jazz promoter and brought many famous jazz bands to Adelaide.  One of the greatest pleasures of his life was motorcycling and after World War II, he established the Rowley Park Speedway.  On the outbreak of World War II, Kym Bonython enlisted immediately and began his training as a pilot at Mascot in the Empire Air Scheme.  He reminisces about the air force staff he knew, his flights in Australia and the South Pacific, and being in hospital there during the bombing of Darwin.  After the end of the War, Kym Bonython ran a Jersey cattle stud at Mount Pleasant for a while.  At the same time, he was collecting modern Australian paintings by Drysdale, Nolan and Arthur Boyd.  From the Jersey stud, Kym Bonython moved into speedway entrepreneurials, record shops, radio shows, and jazz concerts.  Because he ran art galleries in Adelaide and Sydney, Kym Bonython knew most of Australia╩╝s post World War II artists and he shares his memories with the interviewer.","Bonython, Kym, 1920-2011;Rowley Park Speedway;Jazz;Art",'Eminent Australians' Oral History Project;J.

Tony Ryan, one of nine children, three girls and six boys, was born in Burra in 1923.  The family lived in crowded conditions in two of the miners╩╝ cottages.  His father was an experienced farm labourer who was really interested in mining.  Tony attended St. Joseph╩╝s School from 1929 to 1936.  He attributes his strong Catholic faith to the mother and the nuns.  During his youth Anthony boxed, cycled and played football.  After leaving school he worked in the shearing sheds of Mt. Horrocks and Princess Royal Stations.  There he worked alongside experienced shearers from whom he learnt much.  He was appointed the union representative to negotiate with the station managers.  Although he spent some time working in Adelaide, Tony was shearing when World War II broke out.  Because shearing was an essential occupation, Tony╩╝s application to enlist was refused.  Later Tony and his brother Pat became shearing contractors working all over South Australia.  The interview provides many details about shearing and contracting conditions post World War II.  With a daughter with Down Syndrome and a son entering secondary education, Tony moved his family to Adelaide.  He became a shearing instructor in the South Australian Department of Agriculture.  His courses began as farm and shed management for prospective farmers and then developed into specialist training for shearers.  Tony became the senior shearing instructor of Australia with the Wool Corporation.  He also helped established the Shearing Competition Federation.  Tony went to Asia and Africa to demonstrate Australian shearing practices.  The strength of this interview lies in its details, for example combs and cutters, the physical health and training of shearers etc.  Tony concluded with a short account of his recreational activities and voluntary work.","Ryan, Anthony Joseph;Shearing Competition Federation;Sheep shearers (Persons)",Anthony Joseph Ryan;J.

The family fell on hard times during the Depression because of the failure of his father╩╝s property investments. Len went to school at the Sisters of St Joseph and Marist Brothers at Norwood. He initially went to work with the Shell Co.  Len enlisted in the Air Force and served in New Guinea during World War II as a wireless radio telegraphist. Len speaks of the influence of his parents. He believed from earliest times he had a vocation to be a lawyer and a barrister. He was able to undertake studies under the Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme which came into operation after World War II. Len recalls the difficulties in joining a legal practice following the completion of his law studies.  Len married in 24 January 1953 when 27 years old. Len talks of his early involvement with the Australian Labor Party. He joined soon after his discharge from the Air Force in 1946. He became a delegate to ALP Convention and delegate to ALP Council. Len recalls Don Dunstan joining the sub-branch in about early 1950. Dunstan╩╝s ambition was definitely political. He was indefatigable in his efforts to become known in the district. The task of selling Dunstan to the Labor hierarchy was not an issue. Len╩╝s main contribution was involved with licensing issues. Len╩╝s practice was flourishing by 1965.

He speaks about his positions within the party, including his record period as state president of the Australian Labor Party. He was responsible for the introduction of the Card System for voting at conferences. This played an important part in the endorsement of Don Dunstan for the seat of Norwood. Clyde explains the manner in which he used his book of voting slips to ensure Dunstan received endorsement, and not be seen to have done so. Dunstan won by c500 votes. Clyde speaks of his meeting Dunstan while the latter was at the University. Dunstan sought Clyde╩╝s help to have his membership of the Labor Party endorsed by the state executive of the Party in view of his previous political memberships. This would ensure that he could not be expelled by any other body other than the state executive. Clyde elaborates on the qualities of Dunstan that so impressed him. Clyde explains how he assisted Dunstan in obtaining his first real case as a lawyer. He persuaded a group of migrants in a hostel to have Dunstan argue their case against the government increasing fees contrary to an early agreement. Dunstan won the case. This increased his profile and encouraged other work. However, Dunstan still wanted to enter politics.  CC elaborates on the early advice he gave to DD to make him more appealing to the electorate. Clyde reflects on Dunstan╩╝s role as Attorney-General in the Walsh government. He also spoke of the manner in which Dunstan promoted the reform the voting for members of the upper house and the courage that this required because of current Labor Party policy supporting the abolition of the Legislative Council. Dunstan carefully weighed all matters before he took them to caucus, weighing up the manner in which members would vote. He personally lobbied members when there was likely to be a close vote.

He gained a Bachelor of Engineering from the University of Western Australia in 1932.  Ron Fitch was a member of the University Engineers Club and was its President in 1931. The students helped build the Engineering laboratories at the University in 1930.  Ron worked for the Western Australian Railways from 1927 for 22 years.  One of his first jobs as a graduate engineer was working with   a gang of unemployed men during the Depression under a ╩╗make-work╩╝ scheme along the railway line.  In 1949 he completed a Masters of Engineering and moved to Port Augusta as a chief civil engineer for the Commonwealth Railways.

He owned a supermarket in Cloncurry and sold wine there. He bought an opal mine and made a lot of money. He travelled the world and became a wine collector  made more money from a mining company and invested in a winery owned by Perc McGuigan- Wyndham Estate. Brian McGuigan was employed to run it and they bought wine from Penfolds and relabelled it  under their brand. Brian was offered a percentage of the turnover to increase sales. They were the first winery to provide large amounts of food and 50 buses arrived on a Saturday and they'd cook 1500 steaks. They formed a management committee and built 8 wineries under contract, including Hunter Estate. They started to put on entertainment including a concert with Marcia Hines and traffic was backed up for 7 kms. They developed Traminer Riesling in 1972 and within 10 years had 70 competitors. They renamed it TR2 in 1982. They started to export wine in 1982. They bought Douglas Lamb in Sydney to get into distribution and had depots in every state. The managing director of sales was Joe Mellis. They were the first to start wine lists in restaurants. Introduction of technology was a big turning point. Other important changes were transport by tankers and vertigation. They also had a paddleboat on the lake. They were the first to use pressure sensitive labelling and won many labelling awards.

In 1970, Perc's son Brain founded the Wyndham Estate brand located at the old Penfolds Dalwood property. In 1985, the company was public listed and under its portfolio was an array of renowned brands. From there, Brian and Fay launched Brian McGuigan Wines Limited in 1992 - starting again from scratch in the Hunter Valley. From a zero sales base, in little over a decade, sales are over one million cases, about 50% of which is sold into the International market.

His parents bought a citrus property in 1961, then another block where the current winery is. They planted 30 acres of vines. Bill was educated at Loxton and Kingston and then Roseworthy to study oenology. He always worked on the family property as a child. His father built a winery and it was expected that he and his brother would work in it eventually. At that time the Riverland had a bad reputation for wine making even though they provided the grapes to Orlando. He had no contact with other Riverland winemakers. They were mainly into quantity rather than quality but Ian McKenzie set the foundations for premium winemaking. Roseworthy did not teach him how to make wine but how to learn to make wine. His first vintage was in 1986 and he was still learning how to make wine. In 1987 he had a good Shiraz by selecting the best fruit. He was committed to making botrytis wines and he sourced his fruit from many growers in the Riverland. He encouraged the growers to improve the quality of the grapes. He did his first bottling in 1986 - 9,000 litres. It was difficult to sell the Kingston Estate brand and Patrick Forbes from Austrade helped him with export from 1987/88.

They had five children. They bought 650 acres at Richmond Grove, Sandy Hollow in the Hunter Valley. Brian McGuigan gave advice about growing grapes. Began planting in 1969 and Penfolds contracted them to grow grapes. Brian encouraged them to grow Traminer Riesling. Wyndham Estate bought half their property and the vineyard was extended to 250 acres. Len Evans was a source of information about the Hunter Valley. They founded Richmond Grove but Brian McGuigan was the driving force.;Dr Bruce Shepherd of ""Richmond Grove"". Dr Bruce Shepherd was born in Tamworth in 1932 and graduated originally in dentistry from Sydney University with B.B.S. in 1953. He then did medicine, graduating M.B.B.S. Sydney University in 1958. After the usual training in England, Dr Shepherd gained his F.R.C.S. London and F.R.C.S. Edinburgh in 1961 and upon returning to Australia, became a F.R.A.C.S. in 1964, specialising in orthopaedic surgery. Whilst on a holiday with his friend John Muddle in the late 1970s, the idea of establishing the Richmond Grove vineyard was begun. John Muddle had just bought a cattle property called Richmond Grove in the upper Hunter Valley vineyard area, but knew nothing about wine, preferring to drink beer. Dr Shepherd educated him about the virtues of wine and suggested establishing a vineyard on his property. Brian McGuigan was brought in as the technical consultant and each person John Muddle, Dr Shepherd and Brian McGuigan was an equal third partner in the new vineyard. The initial planting of 29 acres of Semillon and Shiraz commenced in 1969. John Muddle became so involved with the vineyard that Dr Shepherd sold out his share in the vineyard after a year or so. Later Brian McGuigan went to run the Wyndham Estate operations, leaving John Muddle in full control. The wheel went full circle with the Wyndham Estate syndicate under Brian McGuigan, buying Richmond Grove.

They were instrumental in getting more funding for the Australian Wine Research Institute. Wine production increased in the 1960s in part due to immigration from Mediterranean countries.

His great great grandfather George Manning was the first winemaker in McLaren Vale. After returning from World War II Bernard was granted a War Service Land Settlement and developed a winery at Loxton. He worked as a field officer for the Citrus Association. His block was 26 acres with a mixture of grape types. He decided to return to Adelaide as a State Manager of the Wine Information Bureau and worked there for 21 years. His job was to promote wine and run wine education courses over 12 weeks which was the only one in Australia. He did a lot of wine tastings at night for clubs. Started in 1967 with Don Rogers doing wine tastings in shopping centres. Over time people started to evaluate wines. Jack Ludbrook was employed by the Association to write about and promote wine in the late 1960s. Barossa Pearl was one of the most successful promotions as people became interested in wine. During his time the industry was family owned and managed and it was easy to get quick decisions. He talks about the Beefsteak and Burgundy Club which met at the Imperial Hotel. This led to clubs forming around Australia. Talks about Wolf Blass and his development of red wines. Wine licences were held by hotels but they gradually made the courts free up more licences for wine shops. Talks about the changes in labelling and wine promotion. He was seconded by the Australian Wine Board to go to Asia and promote Australian wines. Talks about key people in the industry and the growth in many areas. International takeovers have been good for the industry because it has created more opportunities and improved quality.","Stephens, Bernard;Beefsteak and Burgundy Club;Wine Information Bureau;National Wine Centre of Australia;Barossa Pearl (wine)",Treading out the vintage;J.

She left home at 16 to study nursing and married a Mt Barker (WA) farmer at 21. Her parents were from England and had a farm near Fremantle. Her parents were Elizabeth and George Mitchell. Her father was in the merchant navy for 30 years. Betty studied nursing at Fremantle Hospital and moved to the Mt Barker farm in 1959. It was 35 acres of orchard and much of the produce was exported to England. They also ran sheep. It became unprofitable so in 1966 they began to grow grapes with the help of the Department of Agriculture. She learned about viticulture from books and from Bill Jamieson. The first vintage was in 1972. It was an experimental vineyard and they had a lot of problems. She did a lot of work on the vines. They had a 10 year experimental lease with the government. None of the other locals were involved initially. In the late 1970s they started the wine weekends using the business name Great Southern Wine Tours. She talks about a trip to Melbourne in early 1980 for a wine show. They had 40 acres of Chardonay and Gewurztraminer and made their first port in 1984. They did contract winemaking mostly. Talks about the difficulty with birds and the problems with marketing the wine. Their winery at Forest Hill was isolated and had poor cellar sales. They sold their fruit to Micheltons in Victoria and won a gold medal for the wine. They then sold locally to Houghtons. She was made a wine baron of WA when she left the industry. Her marriage broke up and the business was sold. She talks about getting her vigneron licence.,"Quick, Betty;Great Southern Wine Tours;National Wine Centre of Australia",Treading out the vintage;J.

His father was Owen and mother Edna. His grandfather went to Coonawarra in 1901 and worked at Wynns as head cellarman, bought his own 40 acre block in 1908 and started winemaking in 1909. His father had a soldier settler block in Coonawarra. He talks about the family properties - mainly sheep grazing with a small amount of grapes and a small winery  most of the wine was sold in bulk. Their winery was Rouge Homme which his father sold when Bruce was 12. Father bought Arthur Hoffman's vineyard and made wine for the Redman label. First wine was produced in 1968 when the new winery was built. Bruce went to school in Adelaide and to Roseworthy 1972-1975 to study wine making. Pam Dunsford was the first woman to do the course in 1973. Principal was Herriot and it was very strictly run. All students had to board. Management went from the Department of Agriculture to the Department of Education. It had a working winery where they had their lectures, Bob Baker ran the course. Dave Bruer taught chemistry. His first job was at Chateau Reynella for three years as an assistant winemaker. His first job was to blend 500,000 litres of sherry. He went to Coonawarra in 1976 to buy grapes for Reynella and it had grown a lot especially with red wines. He went to Krondorf in 1979 and worked with Burge and Wilson for a year and then went overseas. He did a vintage in Bordeaux for Chateau Beau Site - very basic machinery and conditions  always had wine with their food  French did not think much of Australian wine. Then worked in the Aspen ski fields and returned home to Coonawarra in 1981. There had been a big growth in red wine. He went into business with his brother Malcolm and produced 15-20,000 cases. Started to export to the UK but concentrated on the domestic market and making consistently good wine. Parents spent many years building the profile of Redman wines.

She was born on 1 February 1945 at Bleasdale near Langhorne Creek. She went to Langhorne Creek Primary School, Woodland CEGGS in Adelaide, Adelaide High School and then university. She is the fifth generation of the family at Langhorne Creek. She gives a history of the family beginning with Frank Potts who arrived in South Australia on the 'Buffalo' in 1836. The first Governor was on the same ship. The family has been at Langhorne Creek since 1850  vineyards were first planted in the 1860s and planted on the flood plain. Until the 1960s all the wineries were fortified. Wine was sent in bulk by rail to outlets who did their own bottling. Her father taught her about wine. Her mother did office work for her father at the winery. Ann's grandparents on her father's side owned the Langhorne Creek Hotel. When her parents married they worked at the winery and bought their own vineyards. They started work at Bleasdale in 1977 and did wine testing. In 1961 Bleasdale made its first varietal red Malbec  then Cabernet and Shiraz. In the late 1960s they started making white wines with fortified Verdelho  Wolf Blass was used as a consultant. The first sparkling wine was Bremer Gold which was made in a beer keg. She talks about community life in Langhorne Creek and the people of the area. Talks about changes since 1977 - fermentation process, refrigeration, hand bottling and environmental changes. Flooding at the Bremer, use of bore water and installation of a private pipeline. Biggest change was from fortified wine to table wine as people became more sophisticated about wine drinking. Bleasdale started wine exporting through Emu Wine Company mainly to England. Started exporting table wines to the USA in the early 1980s and are now well known overseas. They still continue to operate as a family business with a privately owned company, now the fifth generation.","Scutchings, Ann, 1945-;Bleasdale Winery -- South Australia;National Wine Centre of Australia;Buffalo (Ship);Langhorne Creek (S.A.)",Treading out the vintage;J.

He married in 1945 and at the end of the war he worked for his father who had vineyards at Modbury, Tea Tree Gully and Hope Valley. David looked after the vineyards and by the 1970s they had 250 acres of premium wines in the Barossa. In the early 1950s they bought 100 acres of land at Qualco in the Riverland and planted a variety of grapes. In the 1950s their winemaker was Reg Tolley. Each vineyard had its own manager. The Adelaide vineyards were compulsorily acquired by the government for housing in the 1960s so they bought additional grapes from the Riverland and the Barossa. In 1971 he planted cuttings of new varieties - Gewurstraminer, Sylvaner and Pinot Noir- in the Barossa. His grandfather Douglas Tolley bought bulk wine from the Coonawarra in the 1920s. In 1989 he bought 100 acres at Padthaway and planted premium grapes. The biggest change in the industry was refrigeration and controlled fermentation.

He did town planning at Melbourne University and returned to Western Australia to work in the Pilbara for 25 years from the 1960s to the early 1980s, working for mining companies. He married Jeanette in 1961 and they have four children. After the Pilbara he moved to Margaret River and bought land on Caves Road planting vines in 1981 and 1982. He travelled from Perth every weekend. Only a few vineyards were established at the time. He planted Pinot and Chardonnay and used Bill Jamieson as a consultant. Bill advised him to replace the Pinot with Cabernet which he did. The first vintage in 1987 won a prize at the SGIO awards in Perth. Winemakers were Rob Bowen, Dorham Mann and Gary Baldwin then his son Edward. Colin went to California, Italy, France, New Zealand and South Africa to look at wineries. He went to Tarrawarra in Victoria to get design ideas for his property and built his buildings out of rammed earth. He also grows Semillon and was the first to blend it with Sauvignon in the 1990s. He employs 16 staff in the picking season and bottles about 10,000 cases. His son Edward oversees the vineyard. He has just built a new cellar and all the casks are underground. WA is very parochial about its wine which helped the area to flourish. He talks about the local wine association and his property Lenton Brae which is 24 acres.","Tomlinson, Bruce, 1936-;National Wine Centre of Australia;Margaret River (W.A.)",Treading out the vintage;J.

His parents were Trevor and Gwendoline. His father was a surveyor. He was educated in Fiji and then studied as a veterinarian at Sydney University in 1947. His father became commissioner for native lands. Bill became a veterinarian in Maitland South Australia and then moved to Albany in Western Australia in the late 1960s. It was still frontier country and he was very busy in his business. He was interested in wine and did some research on the climate around Albany. He put in his first vines in 1982. He bought them from Cullens (mixed clones)and planted pinot. They can be difficult to grow but he had good soil with deep reserve moisture. He also planted Chardonnay. He had ten acres to start with and later another ten acres, increasing his varieties to include Cabernet and Shiraz. Up to 1997 he was contract winemaking for Plantagenet. He talks about the local wine association which aimed to market the region. He became Secretary/Treasurer. He had a very good response to his first vintage of Pinot and Chardonnay. It won the SGIO at the Perth Show in 1987 and won him a trip to France. He built his own winery in 1997 and the wine maker was Ben Kogi. He makes about 10,000 cases a year (110 tons). They do a lot of marketing through special events such as weddings, blues concerts etc. They need to develop their overseas market more. The winery will stay under family control.;With the planting of the first ten acres of vines in 1982, Wignalls King River vineyard was up and running as a prestigious Australian small label.

A few years after World War II the older residents decided they needed a community hall as a memorial to the soldiers. He and his father were on the committee. They bought a chicken shed and used this material as well as local timber to build the hall and his father donated the land. The hall became central to community life for meetings and functions - card games, table tennis, dances and parties. It opened in the early 1950s and in the late 1950s it was extended. They paid the bricklayer and electrician and the rest was voluntary labour. He was on the committee for 40 years including 12 as secretary. Eight men were on the original committee. The community diminished when the school closed. After he moved to Victor Harbour he donated more land to build a car park. He talks about the 1936 celebrations of 100 years settlement of South Australia - tree planting, pioneer memorial, new drum for the school and a church sun dial. The school had only one teacher for 21 years - Miss Jarvis was very strict and she had up to 30 students. It closed in the late 1960s and the children went to Mt Barker.

The Trust was established in 1936 and was appointed by the Women's Centenary Council which was established in 1935 with 72 women's organisations represented on it. It raised money to establish a memorial to pioneer women of South Australia's first 100 years and published a book 'A book of South Australia: 100 years"". They established the Book of Remembrance to list the names of women ancestors and this is buried under the statue in the Pioneer Women's Memorial Garden. They held a pageant of women's contribution to the first 100 years and this ran for over two weeks at Her Majesty's Theatre. Mrs Dolling talks about raising 6,250 pounds in the early 1930s. Women drove all over the state to collect the money. They established a Flying Sister Base at Port Augusta. Five of their members formed the Pioneer Women's Memorial Trust - Adelaide Miethke, Phobe Watson, Gisela Siebert, Mrs Paul Maguire and Mrs C Dolling. The committee set up the Flying Doctor base in Alice Springs which cost 5,000 pounds so that there would be a service which supported isolated country women.

Rosemary Crowley was born on 13 July 1938. She graduated in medicine at Melbourne University and St Vincent's Hospital. She lived in California for four years, then returned to Adelaide and retrained, moving to the Community Health Centre when it opened in 1974 at Clovelly Park. Sister Kate Brown was also a founding member. They had to define their role and get to know their community. They were on a salary rather than a fee for service. When medicare was introduced patients no longer had to pay a fee. She dealt with mothers and their children and worked through their problems. She became a family therapist, gave a lot of community talks including childbirth lectures at Torrens House for 10 years  Elva Abrahams worked in Occupational Health and Safety  students from the Flinders University and Medical Centre did placements with them. Rosemary entered Parliament in 1983 and always pushed OH&S issues. It was moved from Health to Industrial Relations and extensive legislation was introduced. The Community Centre had limited facilities but was welcoming to clients  they had weekly meetings and worked as a team. She stood unsuccessfully for Mitcham and then was elected to the Senate in 1983 for the ALP. She saw politics as a way to improve people's health and to continue to improve conditions for women and children. Medicare has worked well but since 1996 the Liberal government has tried to get rid of it. A lot of community health is about preventative care. She managed to get Bob Hawke to visit the Centre  talks about the Centre's relationship with Police, Government departments  started up play schools  talks about Barbara Turner and Dr Deane Southgate.","Crowley, Rosemary;Senate -- Australia;Occupational health and safety",Inner Southern Community Health Service Oral History Project;J.

Carol Nixon, born in 1947, started worked as the receptionist in the Clovelly Park Community Health Centre in 1983.  An experienced administrator, Carol had to learn about the community health services, their relationships with hospital services, the variety of clients and the expertise of other staff.  Carol worked with Doctor Deane Southgate, the Director of the Centre whom she found very supportive.  Carol stressed that in her position she had to learn not to become involved with or take home the problems of clients.  She saw the introduction of community consultation through shopping centre displays, and talking to individuals before starting new programmes, for example, domestic violence which became a real focus for the Clovelly Park Centre.  Carol Nixon believes that the realignment of mental health was dumped on community health with subsequent problems for counsellors as well as clients.  About 1993 Carol moved to the Black Forest Centre where she went out to talk to community groups.  From her perspective, the Black Forest Centre was more accountable to the community than the Clovelly Park Centre.

Josie Southgate is the widow of Doctor Deane Southgate, the founder of the Clovelly Park Community Health Service.  Josie first met her husband at Malvern Methodist Church.  She trained as a nurse in Melbourne and married in 1956.  Doctor Southgate first practised medicine on the corner of South Road and Daws Road where is now the Southern Clinic.  The practice extended as far as Reynella, and the population, many of whom were migrants, grew rapidly in the post World War II years.  During this time, Doctor Southgate became very interested in psychiatric and occupational medicine.  When money became available for community health under the Whitlam Government he worked with Senator Rosemary Crowley, Barb Turner and Elva Abrahams to establish the Clovelly Park Community Health Centre.  Doctor Southgate was also involved with the Flinders Medical Centre and the refinery.  Despite all these activities, he found time for his growing family.  He advocated community health at a time when many doctors were wary of it.  Among his wide ranging interests were the Service to Youth Council, Rotary and professional development for doctors.  The Southgate family had two stays in the United Kingdom in Liverpool and Southampton.  In the late 1980s, Doctor Southgate severed his connection with the Clovelly Park Community Centre.  He was awarded the AM in the year before he died.  After his death, Josie Southgate and the Department of Primary Care at Flinders Medical School established a prize for the student who does the best community health project and an overseas scholarship for a graduate specialising in community health.","Southgate, Josephine",Inner Southern Community Health Service Oral History Project;J.

Ethel Sparre, born in 1936, is a long-time community activist and a former user of the Inner Southern Community Health Services.  The daughter of a single mother, she was reared by her grandparents, attended Croydon Girls Technical High School and sent into secretarial work after leaving school.  Ethel's community activism began when at nineteen years of age she wrote to the Premier, Sir Thomas Playford, seeking more public housing.  In 1960, Ethel, her husband and children moved to Mitchell Park which was just being opened up for housing development.  Then it was just country. Her first community activity for the area was to save Laffers triangle and prevent the concreting of Sturt Creek.  This was an individual effort of collecting signatures on a petition.  Ethel always had to ride a bike or walk since she never learnt to drive.  After the establishment of the community health centre, where she went for hypnotherapy, Ethel realised the value of working in a group.  As her children became teenagers in the mid 1970s, Ethel worked hard for youth facilities, even to the extent of having her house as 'open house'.  She worked with other parents to relocate the Kindergarten away from busy South Road.  Ethel became a community liaison officer for Community Health Service and its staff assisted her efforts in establishing the Mitchell Park Community Association.  She was elected to the Board of the Community Health Service where she quickly learnt 'why you a board and how it worked.'  Youth services and aged care within a local community are Ethel's particular areas of interest and she is particularly concerned that amalgamations will result in the loss of local services.  Ethel's health is failing and her husband has now taken over some of her community activities.","Sparre, Ethel",Inner Southern Community Health Service Oral History Project;J. D.

Wilfrid's charisma and ability as an educator was well known. His work in Zimbabwe between 1946 and 1992. Wilfrid's mother, Amy Morgan Brock, described as 'feisty' and one who went outside the accepted social order. Amy's work in Montessori method teaching recalled. Returns to her father's great practical skills and his many interests, including his great faith. His teaching begins at Scotch College, Adelaide and his studies at the University of Adelaide. His service in the RAAF, despite his pacifism, and work as an Education Officer in the Second World War. Mem's mother Nancy was travelling secretary of the SCM and moving around Australia in the 1930s. She was at Sydney University and majored in Anthropolgy, studying under Margaret Mead. Nancy also met Christobel Pankhurst who encouraged a certain feminism. Relationship to the Methodist stream and George Whitfield from Nancy's family. Mem talks of her passion for public speaking and how that is something that runs in the maternal side of her family. Marriage of Wilfrid and Nancy and their decision to go to Rhodesia after the London Missionary Society said that they could not go to China. Nancy's acute disappointment at the decision.

Kay Lawrence was born in 1947 in Canberra and spent her childhood in Papua New Guinea where the family went when she was six. Her father was a meteorologist. The family stayed in Papua New Guinea for seven years and then  moved to Malaya. Kay always did art at school. She 'fell' into art teaching. She really only determined to be an artist after starting her art course at the Art School. Kay had a diverse schooling experience, then entered Western Teachers' College and the South Australian School of Art. She enjoyed her art practice. Being engaged in things she loved gave her direction in life. She could not imagine a life not doing art. She made good friends and mentors while at art school who gave her confidence, particularly Geoff Wilson who taught her design. Many in the art teaching group became successful. Stephen Killick became well known, Hendrik Kolenberg became a curator. The art course was focused on practice. Kay began teaching at Mount Gambier at the adult education centre. However, her mother was very ill so the Department arranged for her to return to Adelaide and teach at Mitcham Girls Tech for one and a half years. She applied for and won a job at Salisbury Teachers' College in her third year after graduation. She had her first child in 1975 and only then realised the need to make time for her practice otherwise she would never be an artist. She married a co-teacher John Woods and they had two children. They went together to the UK to study where Kay studied tapestry weaving. She found it difficult to find time to teach, engage in her practice and be a parent. It was an isolating experience trying to combine practise as an artist with motherhood. This was reflected in her work at the time. Her first major tapestry was 'A walk around the inside looking out'.

John started with Email in November 1989 as manager of the electric motor plant. John assumed responsibility for dishwasher group in Melbourne after Email acquired Southcorp whitegoods group. The dishwasher plants were joined at Regency Park in 2003. John joined the dishwasher division to oversee a project to develop a dishwasher for the American market. In 2005 he became Operations Manager of the dishwasher division. He was previously deputy general manager of a phosphate mining company on Christmas Island and had been working there for 20 years. Before that he was a rocket motor engineer in the UK and had worked for a time at Woomera on the Jindivik project. He liked Australia so much that he returned to Australia. He was 49 years old when he left Christmas Island. He describes Email at the time he arrived. It still retained the paternalistic Simpson culture. There were many long-term employees. A very comfortable place. The Beverley drier plant did not have the same culture as the other plants. The dishwasher division, however, had the same sense of common ownership as the motor division. People were interested in what they were doing. Head office was in Sydney. There were many plants around the country and in New Zealand. The corporate culture continued to change from Email to Electrolux, particularly with increased standardisation of procedures, and increased emphasis on occupational health and safety and environmental issues. Electrolux gradually drew Email culture into the international awareness of the company. This has improved product development procedures. Some of the older employees found these new procedures difficult to accept. Those who found difficulty decided to leave. John speaks of his philosophy of treating people wishing to leave. John describes the corporate structure of Electrolux and describes the plant, its extent, numbers of workers and output in 1996.

Doug is 60 years old and started with the Simpson company in 1967 as a sheet metal worker at Dudley Park. In 1979 he was appointed to the dishwasher project team at Beverley and has been with the dishwasher division ever since. The company started producing dishwashers here in 1981, after the factory was built in 1980 with a government incentive to attract industry to the new industrial park. It was the first factory. The first dishwasher had about 90% Australian content. Doug compares the current model with the original model. Doug joined the dishwasher project team as a model maker. He remained in the quality department and managed the test carousel. He later joined the corporate audit division. After three years he returned to the quality department of the dishwasher division. He has also been involved in running workshops around Australia and New Zealand. Doug started his apprenticeship in 1962. He has had only two jobs since leaving school. He has been happy in his job and the company. Simpsons was originally a family company into which sons followed fathers. There was a regular Saturday night function. Workers were able to buy groceries at the canteen rather than need to go to shops. There was a barber supplied, and a chaplain. The dishwasher division has always been a happy group. There has been a major change in the ethnic composition of the workers, but all have been assimilated easily. Originally all belonged to unions, but this is no longer the case. The union became involved when the decision was made to close the factory. There have been no strikes because of issues associated with the factory. There are about three people who have been at the factory as long as Doug. Originally new people joined because of word of mouth. Workers are currently recruited from job centres.  Language is not a major issue despite the many national backgrounds. If there is a language issue between a worker and supervisor, there is generally another who can understand the foreign language.

Graham joined the company on 5.3.1987. At that time the company was called Simpson. He quickly learned the skills associated with two or three jobs and soon became shop steward, a position which he retained for seven years. He became involved in  enterprise bargaining. He started when he was about 36 years after 14 years in the Australian Army. He won the job although he had no factory skills. He has always been in the dishwasher division. He underestimated the level of skills required for the factory job. This was driven home when he failed to connect an earth wire. An alert sounded, the entire line stopped. He started on the outer door line. At that time the company was building about 120 units a day. Graham was born in Melbourne, and was called up for National Service. He remained in the Army, but became dissatisfied with the peacetime Army and wanted a change. He describes the factory when he started and comments on the changes that have taken place since. He believes the workers take great pride in their work. Graham started on the door-line,  progressed to the final assembly line and went from there to the packing line. He was packing about 20 units an hour. He remained here for about six years, then volunteered to be a material handler in the store. Graham explains the different skills and the different pay rates associated with them. He explains the gradations from Level 14, the base level. There are basically three levels to reach the top level on the factory floor. Higher levels require particular skills like a trade, which is level 10.  Turnover of permanent staff has been very small. One fellow started at age 16 and left only a year or two ago. Few people were sacked. The 'ethnic' profile of the company has changed a great deal. When Graham started the only migrant groups were Italians and Greeks, and only about one Asian. This changed a great deal about the time Email took over. All get on well with one another.

Salam indicates that she started with Electrolux in February in 2001 and became permanent in July 2001. She briefly explains what she does at the factory. Salam saw a position advertised at the Beverley drier plant and worked there for six months before transferring to Regency Park. Salem says a little more about her work on the line, as a 'computer programmer' for the control panels of the machines. She explains how people belong to teams and rotate between tasks during the day. She explains that teams may work on several models each day. Salam began working on the packing line. Salam had no specific skills for the task. She had had a few unskilled jobs before beginning at Electrolux. Salam lives at Hectorville. Salam is originally from Eritrea, has been in South Australia for ten years. She migrated with her mother and younger sister, after two elder sisters had migrated to Australia. She had little trouble finding a job. The two elder sisters migrated as refugees, they had no option but to come to Australia. Salam had no English skills when she first migrated, and found the language difficult, but applied herself to learning English. Salam explains how she went about learning the language. Language is not a major issue in the factory: body language is important. Salam is the only worker from Eritrea. Salam believes she has fitted in to the factory very well. There are many different nationalities, but no racial issues. There were no other African people here when she started. There are no specific programs to promote this harmony: people just fit in. The factory does not split along racial lines. Salam talks about company social activities, though these have wound down with the pending closure of the factory. The company provided staff with a Christmas gift. The company is aware of cultural differences such as diet requirements when providing social occasions. Salam has a good friend who is a Muslim. Salam is single and is 31 years old, but has a close boyfriend.

He had only one job previously in a factory making bull-bars for cars. He will be 38 in a few days. He is married with two children. The company was looking for an assembler when he went for the interview. Damian did not bring many skills to the factory. He worked on the assembly line initially. New workers could begin anywhere in the factory. The company tries to match people with the jobs, depending on such characteristics as their size, strength, gender, etc. Since beginning, he has worked in all areas of the factory concerned with assembly: he has been a team leader in all areas. He was here about five years before being appointed a team leader. He applied for and was given the position when it became vacant. The role of a team leader is to show people the right way to act, to support them, and take pride in their work. Damian is currently on the carousel for checking machines and undertaking any repairs. He has a team of nine. He explains the various tasks at each station as the machine travels the carousel. As a team leader at Electrolux he is responsible for supporting his team, relieving those who need to leave the line briefly, and otherwise repairing any machines considered to be faulty. Most problems occur when new models are introduced: they usually involve parts not being fitted together properly. The factory layout has changed since Damian started. The factory has changed in the last five years. So have machines changed, especially with new pumps. Each change generally makes work easier. Changing lines and introduction of new machines is generally done during down time, over Christmas during a shut down. On rare occasions workers have agreed to take time off to permit changes to production lines. There are occupational health and safety representatives on the floor. Issues are generally referred to team leaders first of all, then to those further up.","Chandler, Damian;Electrolux",History Trust of South Australia Oral History Project;J. D.

Lahie started with the company in 2001. He learned of the casual job after moving to Adelaide after some time living in Sydney. It was the first time he had taken on a factory job. He has found it fascinating. Lahie brought no particular skills to the factory, but was eager to learn new skills and took pride in doing so. He had previously had a range of jobs, in hotels, offices, most recently working around the world with Cirque de Soleil. He speaks about his experience with Cirque, and the need to settle down. Lahie is in his forties, he has a son who lives with him and is aged five years. He had no family when travelling with Cirque. He is from Hawaii originally, his mother being FilippinoJapanese and his father was from Samoa who had moved to Hawaii when only seven years old. Lahie found little opportunity in Hawaii and wanted to travel and experience the world. He has been in Australia since immigrating in 1983, when his family migrated to Sydney. He has been back to Hawaii since. He travelled and worked around the world and Australia and finally decided to return to Australia in c1997. He has been an Australian citizen since 1985. He began at the factory under Electrolux. He speaks of the factory at the time he started and highlights some of the changes since, principally to the dishwashers. Lahie is in charge of the pump area and the side plate. He describes his tasks and his approach to the job. He is not a team-leader, but sees part of his role in trying to ensure the happiness of the team. He first worked on the side-plate when he began at the factory. He later worked on the carousel when the American machine was being produced. He has also working in the final packaging line, then learned how to make pumps. Lahie comments on turnover of permanent workers, and issues of working in the various teams. He has experienced many people who do not particularly want to be on the line, but are there because of Centre Link.

Widely published as a children's author, Elizabeth Hutchins has also co-authored several school histories and is now writing historical fiction. Her work in progress, 'One for Sorrow', is the story of her feisty great-grandmother Isabella Marshall, who emigrated to Adelaide from Ireland in 1855 to escape an arranged marriage. Her first nonfiction biography of her grant-grandparents, 'The China Dogs' was published in 1988. 'One for Sorrow' draws on childhood memories of tales that have been passed down for 150 years, interviews with family members and subsequent research  but where 'the facts' end imagination takes over. Elizabeth's presentation outlined the process of turning fact into fiction. It's an approach that gives rise to challenges, since often a writer has to deal with flawed, incomplete and contradictory accounts - not to mention facts that have been deliberately concealed. Jill Golden grew up in post-war Sydney. A graduate of Sydney University, she moved to Canada where she taught English in secondary schools for five years. She returned to Australia in 1970 to raise her two daughters and now teaches English Literature at Flinders University. Her first collection of stories, 'Jess', was published in 1987. Her new novel 'Inventing Beatrice' is based on letters and diaries discovered in 1994, after her mother's death. Jill talked about the dilemmas  legal and ethical  that unfolded as she thought about how she might use this treasure trove. Subsequent conversations with elderly friends and relatives who knew and remembered the people and events she wanted to write about, added a new layer of complexity. Jill discussed her decision to write a book that combines fictional sections (that draw heavily on factual material) with first person factual narrative, to produce a story that is a product both of imagination and of history.

His father Frank was a descendant of Henry Owen who was born on the ""Buffalo"" in 1836  his mother was Margaret Cotton and he had four sisters. Frank successfully applied to the Army Apprentices School in Victoria when he was fifteen years old.  There he spent three years completing the motor mechanics course with a further year in Adelaide. His first posting was to Puckapunyal where he worked as a tank mechanic on British Centurion tanks for five years.  Readers interested in tank mechanics will learn much from Frank's interview.  In 1964 Frank left the Army, married and went to work in the Department of Supply workshops, again on army vehicles and joined the Army Reserve.  Frank re-enlisted in the Army in 1968, completed the promotion to corporal and was posted to Vietnam.  Mr. Owen's memories of Vietnam include the social life, concert tours, interpersonal relations, pet monkeys as well the technical details of his work.  After his tour of Vietnam, Frank returned to his wife and children at Puckapunyal for two years where he was promoted to staff sergeant.  From there Frank, his wife and family were posted to Singapore for two years.  There he was production control officer and promoted to warrant officer.  Then the family was posted to Port Moresby for eighteen months.  They did not find Port Moresby as congenial as Singapore.  After returning to Australia, Frank moved between Adelaide and Melbourne.  He decided to leave the Army in 1986 and return to Adelaide, much to the disappointment of his wife and family.  There he spent thirteen years as a casual in the courts.  Frank retired in 1998 on a service pension.  He is active in the Returned Services League and received an OAM for this work in 2007.

Colleen studied as a nurse and then joined the Army in 1965. The daughter of a World War II army nurse, Colleen was born in Port Augusta began her nursing career there before coming to Adelaide for her staffing year.  She joined the army in 1965, and did her training in Queensland before being posted to Vietnam.  Colleen had expected to be in a field hospital but Vung Tau was a field ambulance station for her first five months before it was upgraded to a field hospital.  Nevertheless, the medical staff at Vung Tau had to provide the full range of medical operations with very limited resources.  They learnt very quickly to 'beg, borrow or steal off the Americans'.  Colleen described in vivid detail the 1968 Tet Offensive when all the staff worked for thirty six hours straight.  Seven soldiers were killed and there were seventy five wounded in the hospital.  She spent five and half years in the army going in as a lieutenant and coming out as an acting major.  Colleen met her husband, also in the Army, after her return to Australia.  Once married, she had to leave the army and endure the travails of an army with a husband wounded in Vietnam.  Colleen is very active in the Vietnam Veterans Association in Canberra and for which she received the AM in 1995.  She counts the 1986 Veterans March in Sydney, the Canberra Memorial to Veterans and her presidency of the RSL in Canberra as her major achievements.  A Vietnam veteran herself, Colleen suffered post-traumatic stress.

Her determination paid off and she started the very next day as a Computing Assistant in the Special Services section. On that very first day with the Bureau, she met her immediate supervisor and future husband John Armstrong. John and Vicki hit it off straight away and were married in August 1969. In 1970 Vicki was pregnant with their first child and left the Bureau to focus on motherhood. Vicki went from being a Bureau staffer to being a Bureau wife. By the 1980s, however, Vicki and John had had enough of life in a big city. It was fun when they were younger, but with a family they yearned for a change. Vicki wanted to come home to Adelaide, and encouraged John to apply for the Regional Director's position in South Australia.

His first experience of working was during the university vacations. At that time, the Regional Director was Allan Brunt and Bruce's boss effectively was Len Broadbridge at Western Offices. Bruce cut his teeth learning from an experienced older generation of forecasters dating from the war era. Technologically, in the seventies, forecasting was more difficult as it relied for its data on monitoring shipping at relatively close range in the Indian Ocean. This was the era of fledgling visual satellite imagery forecasting and this graduated to infrared imagery which provided a valuable new source of information for forecast mapping.

Mika Peace joined the Bureau of Meteorology in 2003 after doing a science degree at Flinders University. Her degree focussed on oceanography, which initially led her to work at the National Tidal Facility before it joined the Bureau and became the National Tidal Centre. It was a time of upheaval and uncertainty for the Tidal Centre so Mika applied for and was accepted into the 2003 Met Course in Melbourne. When Mika did her training it was the first time ever that they'd had equal numbers of males and females on the course. Mika has been forecasting for three and a half years in Adelaide. As a new graduate, however, Mika spent seven months as a forecaster in Darwin. Because of its location and tropical climate, Mika says that Darwin definitely broadened her forecasting experience.  Currently a junior forecaster, Mika hopes to one day fill a senior forecasting position.  Mika has recently relieved the position of Public Weather and Marine Officer, which she thoroughly enjoyed.

His first posting found him and Coral a long way from home when Ed was sent as relieving OIC to Port Hedland in WA. Unfortunately there was no accommodation for families so Coral had to stay in Perth with their two children. Conditions were tough, but having grown up during the Depression era they were prepared to put up with the difficulties. In the mid-fifties they were posted to Alice Springs where, in spite of the cockroaches and red back spiders, they felt they had finally fallen on their feet.

During 1941, the Bureau was subsumed into the RAAF and Errol was relocated from Parafield Aerodrome to the first of many war-time postings to the Air Navigation School at Cootamundra where he had responsibility for forecasting services, and then to Wagga. It was during this posting that Errol married Mabel. His next posting was to the field station at Camden, near Sydney in 1943 where the Hudson 32 Squadron was located after service in New Guinea. He was there when the Japanese mini-subs were discovered in Sydney Harbour. Errol was sent to Goodenough Island, in the Doncaster group of islands, north of New Guinea for the duration of the war. In 1956-57, whilst in charge of the forecasting warning sections in Adelaide, Errol was sent to Maralinga to observe cloud abnormalities for all the major trials conducted. Errol was posted to the Sydney Regional office in 1963 and coordinated the Hydrological and Meteorological branches of the service in providing flood forecasting services for the NSW Northern Rivers District.

Terry Turner describes how he came to start as a Junior Observer at the Bureau in Adelaide in the late 1960s. He did his training in Perth and then returned to Adelaide when National Service intervened. Terry worked at the proof range at Port Wakefield in the armed forces but actually performed civilian work for the Bureau. Terry describes the unusual relationships that existed between Bureau staff and the Military at the time, and later between Aviation Meteorology at the Airport and the Regional Forecasting Centre at West Terrace. He was moved to Sydney for a time and also to Tasmania for ten years before returning to Adelaide Airport as Officer in Charge. After closing the Weather Service Offices at the airports, Terry spent the remainder of his career overseeing the aviation area at the Regional Forecasting Centre at Kent Town. He says losing direct contact with pilots as a result of this move was a major loss. Terry provides many reminiscences of the characters at the Bureau and various interrelationships during his time at the Bureau.

D. Somerville Oral History Collection.  In the interview she talks about her personal life and family, her writing career, the nuts and bolts of a writer's work, influences and observations. She talks about her English youth, including teenage years divided between boarding school and her mother's and stepfather's home in Nigeria (her father died when she was 14), her education at Oxford, and the influences on her later career as a writer. These included a love of reading, a fascination with Japan, and a love of languages. She describes her work in London, a brief first marriage and then marriage to Philip Rubinstein and her eventful emigration by ship to Australia (including being held at the North Head Quarantine Station). Philip worked in public health in Sydney and then Lismore, and finally in Adelaide. Gillian has three children Matthew, Tessa, and Susannah. Gillian was active in the Uniting Church in Paddington and Byron Bay, where the family moved after Sydney. She describes their first impressions on moving to Adelaide in 1981, and the stimulus for writing her first novel, 'Space Demons'. She discusses writing children's fiction through familiarity with her children's Australian lives, as her way into Australian culture, and the South Australian setting of her children's books, including the suburb of Lynton (in Foxspell), where the family lived for 11 years, and Yorke Peninsula (Beyond the Labyrinth). She discusses the influences of life since 1997 in the south coast town of Goolwa. She describes publishers, agents, writer friends and groups, energetic writing years producing not only children's books but also theatre, speaking appearances, school 'performances', boards and committees, collaborative work. She describes attitudes towards a writer of children's fiction, and the increasingly adult themes ;Gillian Rubinstein (nee Hanson) is a widely-published, award-winning author, writing children's books and plays under her own name, and adult books under the pseudonym Lian Hearn. Rubinstein was born in 1942 in 'an English village called Potten End. Her teenage years were divided between boarding school and her mother's and stepfather's home in Kano, Northern Nigeria. She studied Modern Languages at Oxford University, married Philip Rubinstein in 1973 and migrated to Australia in the same year, where they raised three children. They lived in Sydney, Byron Bay, Adelaide and Goolwa. After the family moved to Adelaide in 1981 she started writing a novel, and has since written over 30 books, eight plays, short stories and articles, gaining a national and international reputation. Her first book, Space Demons (1986) was extremely popular, and introduced the themes of growing up and mixing real life and fantasy worlds which were followed in later books.  Most of her children's books also refer to the South Australian setting, where she has lived since 1981. Space Demons and other books such as At Ardilla, Foxspell and Galax-Arena received critical acclaim. She won the Children's Book Council Book of the Year twice, and had several books listed as Honour Books in the same awards. She won the Festival Award twice, the New South Wales Premier's Award for Answers to Brut and the YABBA Award (a Children's Choice award). In 1996 her stage adaptation of Galax-Arena won the AWGIE for Best Theatre for Young People. She received two Category A Fellowships from the Literature Board of the Australia Council, and the SA Great Award for Literature in 1998. She was a member of the Literature Fund of the Australia Council from 1995-8, and was a guest speaker the major Australian Writers' Festivals, the Edinburgh Children's Book Festival and the Vancouver Writer's Festival. In 1998 she was Writer in Residence at the English School's Foundation School in Hong Kong, and in 1999 she visited Japan as an Asialink Fellowship recipient.

Born and raised in Vietnam, they met and married while studying medicine at Saigon University in the 1970s. They graduated in 1979 and spent as long as they could under the Communist regime before making the life-changing - and endangering - decision to leave Vietnam. ""After we got married and finished our studies, we wanted to stay in Vietnam and help our country rebuild after the war,"" Dr Tam Doan says. ""But after a while it became obvious to us that our philosophies on life weren't compatible with those running the country, and we made the decision to escape. My brothers and I organised for us to escape - it took a lot of planning over a long time, about a year, for it to occur. But the whole time, we knew we were doing the right thing for us and it was worth taking the risk."" On March 26, 1981, Tam, Thanh-Tam and their six-month-old son Hieu left Vietnam in a boat with 66 other people and headed across the South China Sea for Malaysia. The journey took seven days, and was perilous from beginning to end. ""We were escaping from Vietnam illegally, so if we had been discovered by Vietnamese authorities in Vietnamese waters, we would have been in a lot of trouble,"" Dr Thanh-Tam Pham says. ""When we were very close to Malaysian waters, we were intercepted by some Thai pirates - it was frightening as we could see Malaysian islands in the distance and we were so close to our goal. Luckily, they just wanted our possessions so we gave them all we had and they let us go.""
