Challenges:
- Highlight the diversity of South Australia's tourism product through gamification
  - How can we apply gamification to engage and educate young (South) Australians about South Australia's diverse tourism product offer and through this, influence key decision makers in their household to discover more of South Australia?
- Increase visitor expenditure through Smart Tourism
  - How can we use digital technology to "upsell" to visitors to South Australia by uncovering additional attractions and experiences and/or extending their stay?
